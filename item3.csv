"Cape Dory Sailor","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts arrived unbelievably large; A size Large is much larger than a large in any other brand like J. Crew, Gap, Prana, Patagonia, any of Target's brands, etc.
I washed them on cold, and then the absolute lowest setting on my dryer. The shirts shrunk to be about the size of a J. Crew Medium, despite being exposed to virtually no heat, and cold water. I can't imagine what will happen when I wash them next. But, what's really crazy is the differences in each shirt. I had to throw one shirt away immediately after washing, because it was, no exaggeration, 4"" shorter than the other shirts. It came down to above my belly button. None of the shirts are symmetrical, and none of them fit or are sewn the same as the other shirts. I assume these are hand made by people that are new to garment sewing. There are odd skipped and uneven stitches, which is something I've never noticed in any other factory produced garment. On top of all of this, these are paper thin shirts. Wearing the white shirt as an undershirt under a plain white button up, and you can see right through both shirts; these are definitely not appropriate shirts to wear on their own.
I'll be using these as undershirts, but I'm never buying anything from this brand again. I have shirts from other inexpensive brands that were just a little more expensive that are far better in both fit and quality."
"mOejOe33","1.0 out of 5 stars","Major inconsistencies from all 5 shirts. Most noticeable was the ""V"", which isn't centered. The ""V"" also drops down WAY TOO LOW wherein my inner collarbone is completely exposed. I was hoping that after washing it would slightly shrink to fit better...all it did was shrink the length of the (already super short) sleeves."
"VXZ","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about. These shirts when compared to Hanes Our Most Comfortable, feels terrible. Feels very rough compared to my used Hanes.dont waste your money. Buy the Hanes one at Sam's Club."
"Alex","1.0 out of 5 stars","Absolutely disgusting and a waste. The entire pack was dirty used shirts, none were even a large. Only one was even a gildan brand shirt. The rest were used Hanes shirts. Should have checked earlier. No wonder the bottom was taped. HOW GROSS."
"Joel K","1.0 out of 5 stars","Don’t waste your money on these, they are terribly cheap and the necks lose their shape after a single wash.
I literally received these less than a week ago, washed them with the hopes they’d shrink a bit, and was disappointed to see the neck come out of the dryer wavy and not laying flat on every one of the six that came in the package.
I’ve worn Haynes v-necks forever and should have stuck with what I know. Oh well, at least I can make a bunch of shop rags out of these now."
"Mark B.","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are the most uncomfortable T-shirts that I've ever bought (first Gildan purchase here). They are also a little big in the midsection area. I washed them in hoping they would shrink and feel softer too...they didn't. The material is so uncomfortable on the skin. I tried giving to my teenage son and he didn't want them either. lol! We threw them away. I would suggest not buying. Very disappointed with this brand and won't be buying Gildan anything ever again."
"Tyson Davis","1.0 out of 5 stars","Cheap material. Already a hole in one shirt after the second time wearing it."
"Megan Jones","1.0 out of 5 stars","Absolutely a waste of money. I'm a female, wear an XS or S in women's, depending on the brand and cut. I was looking for some cheap t-shirt for pajamas, and these looked great for those purposes. I prefer V-necks, so that was a huge bonus. I ordered a small, thinking that would be perfect, since I'm a women's XS/S (for reference, I'm 5' 6"" and around 110-115 lbs). They looked okay when I took them out of the packaging, but after I washed them, they shrunk terribly and hardly even fit at all. I don't think I'd even be able to wear them as regular shirts, let alone pajamas. The sleeve openings are quite tight, and there as zero shoulder width....they're too narrow even on my frame. The material is also very thick, stiff, and scratchy. The neckline is also not what I'd expect out of a V-neck....more U-shaped after watching, and still quite tight (I hate things close to my throat, so this is a problem). Absolutely do not waste your money on this. Poor material, poor fitting....just poor overall. And if you're a guy....you'll need to order probably 2 sizes up. But you don't want to buy this anyway."
"Norma M","1.0 out of 5 stars","Ordered these July 4th 2019 they seemed okay for the price about $16 at the time. A couple months later they have tiny holes at the bottom and they are various lengths despite being the same size. I wouldn’t recommend these. They stretch in odd places and the v neck is deformed on some. They look like I purchased at a goodwill because of a bad batch. I bought these for work but they’re better off as sleeping shirts. I won’t purchase again. Very disappointed."
"CML","1.0 out of 5 stars","First time I followed reviews over experience and I FAILED! Those shirts had way more great reviews compare to the Amazon essential shirts, that's the reason why I bought them. I use undershirts almost every day for work purposes and decided to give those a try, instead getting the Amazon essential shirts agin, which I already have and love! Big mistake, those shirts are not even close as soft as all other shirts I had before (Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Amazon essential, Nautica etc.). Not comfy because the material is not soft at all, wouldn't recommend them."
"chi-towm","1.0 out of 5 stars","Just opened the package to try on my shirt. I looked in the mirror and noticed the v portion of my shirt was not centered. I tried on all of my shirts and only one was centered. Really wanted these to work but I can't unsee what I now know. Hopefully I can get a refund."
"kevin","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not only did everyone of these tee shirts come with small holes in them THEY WERE MARKED WITH TAPE so you knew there were holes in them. I will be getting a refund but Having to go through the whole refund thing is a hassle . I guess what upset me most was they knew about the hole enough to mark them with tape and sent them anyway. The price was just ok . I bought for the convenience and was way disappointed."
"swiss dude","1.0 out of 5 stars","These aren't great. The sleeves constantly fold up, along with bottom of the shirt. The cut of the fabric at the bottom of the shirt is not fitted, and as shown in the images, pops out away from the body. I'm a 6'1"" slim lad, and they make me look like I put on a few pounds around the belly. Next Level, my old T shirts off Amazon are much much better, for only slightly more. I'll be turning these into some oil rags for the cars. They also shrink quite a bit."
"SmexyGirl","1.0 out of 5 stars","These t-shirts are extremely unflattering to wear. They look like a tent that you'd wrap yourself when it's raining. The cotton fabric is rough on the skin and not soft. These will make great cleaning rags, but I wouldn't wear them out in public."
"Chi-Chi Padre","1.0 out of 5 stars","The product description clearly states that this was supposed to be a five pack of shirts and I got a four pack. Shirts are fine I'm sure as far as fit and feel, but f*** Gildan for the false advertising to make a quick buck. Fix the item description!!"
"Haze Scovern","1.0 out of 5 stars","All my shirts are mediums and they fit just fine. These shirts fit as if they were designed for women; it's tight at the armpits and the shirt length barely passes the waistline. It's also a bit itchy and the texture is very coarse due to their cheap choice of cotton. Probably the worst shirt I've ever worn."
"Cody","1.0 out of 5 stars","I order a pack of the XL. They are like wearing a 3XL in the body and chest. The collar of V neck is made for someone who wears a 5XL. I would order a size or two smaller next time. But they do shrink a lot in the wash. The material is like a Hanes t-shirt."
"MrTIC","1.0 out of 5 stars","They say you get what you pay for. Well it certainly holds true here. I got these on special for $9 and thought it was a good deal. Got them yesterday and washed them. I think my 8 year old can wear them now, they shrunk to nothing on low heat. The worst part is how wrinkled they were. I mean I’d need to iron them just to wear them. Nah sir! Back and the box and going back to Amazon."
"pouya mahdavi","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought a pack of it b/c of all the good reviews, got it last night and thought wash it before use due to Covid-19, and look... one of it have hole and the other one have stain.....
Are you serious......?!?!?!
I don’t know where all of that good review is coming from.....maybe it use to have good quality and then they reduce it for more profit."
"Jackie","1.0 out of 5 stars","When I got these new last week they are perfect out of the package, after the first wash ( cold water gentile cycle in washer and dryer with darks detergent) the shirts shrunk and lost form. Now they fit sloppy and shrunk in odd ways mainly to short.
For the money these are a great value buy you get what you pay for."

"Im joe biden","1.0 out of 5 stars","figured for the price id take a chance and if they sucked i could use them as rags. well....they are rags now. these t shirts are horribly fitting. super loose at the bicep and tight everywhere else. and they are not even soft ! they have a strange rough feeling to them. one wash a dry on low and they shrunk at least by 30% i have t shirts that you can wash hot and dry hot and they dont shrink. guess im sticking with next level."
"Cheryl","1.0 out of 5 stars","Would like to return these but apparently 5 weeks is too late. These were bought for under dress shirts so my husband has only worn a couple of them, but in the month he's had them the ones that were washed have shrunk up to his belt or above. Should be able to return a product that is of such poor quality!"
"M. Remorenko","1.0 out of 5 stars","I put the shirts in the washer right out of the packaging. 1 shirt came out with a sizable hole in the underarm, and another looks like it has loose stitching at the 'V' in the neck. The shirts look like they'd fit well, bit I'm not taking the chance that the others will fall apart too. Returning for a refund."
"Jamill Garcia","1.0 out of 5 stars","Just wanted to state that inside the package was one item that was NOT a v neck and was branded ""George"". The package was sealed so it must be an error in manufacturing. Besides, the t shirts were WAY to big. Strangely, the George one, fitted nicely and it was XL too. Seems I will have to buy from this brand the next time."
"Mel","1.0 out of 5 stars","Was super bummed when we found a hole in one of the shirts... I read that other reviewers had this problem but I was hoping we wouldn't... :("
"snowlion","1.0 out of 5 stars","Each shirt in the pack fit differently and not well. 1 shirt I can't wear because it fits so poorly. Then the underarm seam blew out in this one. Live and learn.
If this Covid 19 has learned us anything, it's that we need to revive manufacturing in America. National security dictates we bring back MADE IN AMERICA! From now on I will make a strong effort to only buy made in the U.S.A. products."
"Richard Kostanski","1.0 out of 5 stars","Out of the box the shirts appeared ok, little short for shirts that were supposed to be big and tall. After one wash, they shrunk up to the equivalent of an XL (These were Big and Tall 2XXL) The price was reasonable, but again...shrunk considerably after one wash."
"william r. fritz","1.0 out of 5 stars","whoever is looking to purchase these tee shirts, do yourself a favor, don't. I trying to save you from doing the same. the tees were wrinkled so I decided to wash them prior to wearing them. when I was folding them afterwards(i'm anal like that) I noticed one tee had a small hole in the front and on another tee the threading on one sleeve was already coming undone.remember cheap is cheap and you get what you pay for"
"Gabriel C.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I wanted to give this brand a try, since the Amazon Basics v-neck t-shirts had sold out. I've noticed stitching has already started to come undone on two of my t-shirts. They've been washed ONCE. Don't bother with this brand and get something better."
"Brit B","1.0 out of 5 stars","These were way larger than expected for a men’s XL. The V in the V neck is also much lower/looser than expected for a men’s shirt. We’d probably return them if we could. Unlikely to order v necks from Gildan again, considering the fit seems super off."
"Eric Youmans","1.0 out of 5 stars","If you're the kind of guy that goes in public wearing a fake gold chain around your neck and fake Rolex on your left wrist the V-neck t-shirt is perfect for you. If you're the kind of guy who fondles his fake gold chain with his left hand whilst caressing his fake Rolex with his right hand the V-neck t-shirt was made specifically for you. If you're not this kind of guy you should steer clear of the V-neck t-shirt as to not be confused for the kind of guy who wears v-neck t-shirts."
"Tom Ramsey","1.0 out of 5 stars","Sold as 5 pack. Picture shows 5 shirts. Package arrived and it was 4 shirts."
"Harry C Webb","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are just awful. They run much larger than most shirts at least for the large. They are very wide and the vneck is massive. Almost fits like nurse scrubs. They also seem to be sewn crooked too. I feel these were designed for larger short folks."
"MarathonWalker","1.0 out of 5 stars","Poor quality, felt cheap and thinner than I would have expected, free delivery was fine but it would have been actually cheaper to go to Walmart- they all ended up performing barely adequately as cleaning rags for my car
I recommend do not purchase"
"David C","1.0 out of 5 stars","Sizes fit as ordered, but these are extremely low quality shirts. Brand new shirt on first wear had holes within a few minutes from poor stitching. A second shirt had stitching falling out right from the pack. 3 of 5 shirts ended up needing to be thrown out after first wear. Hanes, fruit of the loom, even the costco brand T shirts are vastly better. These have terrible stitching and the company must have very subpar quality control. Avoid"
"Laura K","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these to sleep in, and they are rough and itchy, even after multiple washes with fabric softener. They seem to become more rough everytime I wash them. They'll be moved over to the rag pile for cleaning."
"Josito","1.0 out of 5 stars","Low quality, baggy, the M size feels almost like an XL and the fabrics get super stiffed after you wash them the first time. If you are expecting this shirt to fit you well (athletic cut), think twice..."
"TV Personalty LEONARD","1.0 out of 5 stars","They do not wash well in cold water they schunk
They also faded the very first tome I washed them . I liked the v neck but sadly they now are washed shabby looking . I did cold water I Frye’s them omlunon deicate cycle in a brand new washer and a anti fade laundry detergent . I hope they refund my money"
"Manny Zohar","1.0 out of 5 stars","Material ok, length ok, but this item top part is a complete disaster, the V is huge the sleeves are tiny the shoulders seams are for medium ( the distance between the neck and the shoulder seam), so when you wear it the sleeves pop out to the sides since there is no enough length in the overall upper part.
Very bad design, I don't know who can wear it comfortably. The V is big, so it go down to middle of your torso."
"Linda","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are too big even in large. Last time i bought XL but they were humongous. This time i bought the L and they are still big and usually my husband wears large. Also stretch after a couple of washes"
"Amr Nasser","1.0 out of 5 stars","They'll Become Useless After The First Wash !"
"Packin","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these because I really love the brand and the way they fit. I purchased a 5-pack, but only a 4-pack arrived. Beware when ordering. It was a great price for a 5-pack but not for a 4-pack. Not happy, will not recommend to friends."
"lightman","1.0 out of 5 stars","HANES did a much better job, IMHO. This make does not hang properly over your frame; the V-neck sits too high in front, and too low in back--almost like you've got the shirt on backwards."
"Myke","1.0 out of 5 stars","This is an awful shirt. The v is too wide compared to the body of the shirt so it sits very odd. After one wash it shrunk in a way that it twisted and all of them are unwearable. They also have this ""fake"" cotton feel that is awful to hold. It feels tacky for lack of a better term, almost like they used a cheap dye."
"Chute dogger","1.0 out of 5 stars","When I opened package it was obvious that these had been returned before. There was cat hair all over the t-shirts and they were just shoved in the wrapper not even folded neatly. I will not buy again."
"Torrie","1.0 out of 5 stars","Advertised as a (5) pack. What I received was a (4) pack. This was false advertising at the fullest. Would ask for a refund; but it's not worth it. Amazon could do better."
"Cee","1.0 out of 5 stars","Fabric is of very poor quality. Cotton is rough and very uncomfortable against the skin. Cut of the shirt is very odd as well as it doesn't conform to the body at all. Small through the chest, large at the bottom, with big arm holes. Just weird."
"Christopher","1.0 out of 5 stars","Everytime I order any gildan from anywhere I don't get the right pack. Order a 5 pack and of course I received the 4. With they would have people who could count"
"Denise","1.0 out of 5 stars","The material is 100% cotton but after washing the shirts 3 times they have still not softening up. The material feels rough against the skin. I’ll be getting rid of these unfortunately."
"J. Latona","1.0 out of 5 stars","I received the shirts and found 2 of them had no bottom hem sewn in at the bottom of the shirts. Totally unusable and returned them promptly. You get what you pay for, buyer beware."
"MadhuriKC","1.0 out of 5 stars","The material was so stiff and made me itchy. It wasn't soft at all. Returned."
"MJ Star","1.0 out of 5 stars","This shirt is not soft at all. I washed it a few times with fabric softener and it still didn’t get soft. It’s horrible quality. Not a great under shirt at all!"
"Merlin333","1.0 out of 5 stars","Fabric was too thick, coarse, stiff. It was a poor fit - hung like a burlap sack, poorly constructed - the armpit of 3 shirts was not sewn properly - they literally missed stitches leaving a hole in the armpit . They do not have the refined appearance of t-shirts available everywhere, rather they look like surplus t-shirts you'd buy to do yard work or sell to a prison system. I don't know who sells tees that look like these, these days. I'll never buy another"
"Sharing Experience","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are not soft at all, but are a heavy, rough cotton. They also shrink drastically after first wash, so they go from slightly large to way too small. I will not order this brand again."
"C Geis","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shirt does not fit as expected. Thought it would be slimmer/normal size. More of a standard v-kneck. Material is also not that great. Maybe i got a bad batch."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","X- Large runs WAY WAY TOO SMALL. Not wearable!!!!!!"
"MISTER SJEM","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts shrunk considerably making the XL undesirable fits.
I would recommend you never wash them to keep their length or simply buy from someone else.
MY GRADE: C minus."
"eric goeckeritz","1.0 out of 5 stars","If I could leave zero stars as a review, I would. Every single shirt folded up at the hip seam after the first wash. Looks terrible, and even after using an iron, the shirt seams will not lay flat.
Furthermore, the shirts have a very poor fit. The shirt is shaped like a bell. Perhaps I ordered a muumuu by mistake? I am 5 11, and 180lbs, with a normal build. It is inches wider at the hip, then the chest.
Terrible stitching, terrible fit, terrible buy."
"Billy Fitzgerald","1.0 out of 5 stars","Only got 4 shirts!
Nice shirts just missing one, or falsely advertised."
"Ravindra Bhardwaj","1.0 out of 5 stars","After wearing regularly for couple of weeks then fabric got very loose. It looks very loose and did not fit well. I have returned. Thank you Amazon!"
"Danyal S.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Decent Gildan quality, as always and fit/comfort is fine. However, maybe I’m just getting old, but I remember when v-necks weren’t cut so low that you could basically see nipples. The neck is cut way too deep. Like I said, maybe that’s the style Now and I’m getting old, but I’ve not been able to find a v-neck that wasn’t built for rock stars or hipsters in about a decade."
"dave mueller","1.0 out of 5 stars","Worked perfectly out of the packaging but after the first wash... Whoa - turned into a belly shirt and the sleeve shrank too.
Throwaway now as I bought these to be able to tuck them in and stay tucked. That's not happening :("
"OtterDan","1.0 out of 5 stars","I read the reviews here and felt confident that the shirt would not shrink too much. After washing, the length of the T-shirt decreased by almost 2"". Unacceptable. I wore it once after washing and it kept untucking all day long at work. If you like longer T-shirts and you're around 6' tall, don't bother with these."
"Camz","1.0 out of 5 stars","First wash on a delicate cycle the jersey got a hole... poor quality"
"Fabian B.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Based on your size chart I’m suppose to be an XL. When I tried in the shirts, they’re too big, I think your size chart is a little off. Can u be so kind as to send me the correct size, I should be a large. Thanks for ur understanding & help."
"J-tro","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these because I love the Gilda brand, but these shrank really bad the first time I washed them so the fit got weird and the bottom hem on a few of them started unraveling. They are pretty soft though."
"Tai","1.0 out of 5 stars","I wouldn't recommend this product. It creates sooo much static cling and, even when so many dryer sheets are used, it still gets hair stuck to it. Any small lint or fuzz that it comes into contact with sticks to it for eeeever. It's so annoying. I cannot recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to spend hours picking off all the hair off it or enjoys lint rolling their shirts every hour."
"Haztive Dominicana","1.0 out of 5 stars","These fit me well, and yet they all have holes. I do not extend them unnecessarily. I remove them by grabbing the bottom. They felt good when they were new, but now they all have holes."
"Nick Hankins","1.0 out of 5 stars","Medium is a tiny bit big, but not bad.
Issue: super thin and see-through. Probably great as a hidden undershirt, not great as an outfit.
Nips for days.
5’10 and 150lbs"
"Vishal Gupta","1.0 out of 5 stars","Please don't sell such cheap stuff....most horrible product I could ever purchase. Even if this was offered for free I would never take these. There is nothing good about the product hence nothing specific. This is overall very poor !! I wish I had opened my package before the return window."
"Andrew Robinson","1.0 out of 5 stars","After the first wash shirts shrink fit really awkward tight in the chest very loose at the bottom best way to describe it it fits like a Sunday dress looks but as a shirt"
"Bob Sears","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts fit way to small. I ordered a size up. They are ridiculously small and the v neck is way to big. Will not reorder."
"Mike","1.0 out of 5 stars","Typical cotton t shirts, I am not that tall, only 6’ but can never find a T-shirt that fits good. Just like always, the shirt was poofy at the bottom and too short in the back even though they were “slim” fit. Anywho, they will be paint rags."
"Michael E.","1.0 out of 5 stars","DO NOT WASH THEM UNLESS YOU NEED EXTRA WASH CLOTHS. THESE SHRUNK IN COLD AND HUNG DRY. MATERIAL IS VERY SCRATCHY AND FEELS VERY CHEAP."
"SA","1.0 out of 5 stars","I can't believe that more than 10000 reviews with 4.5 stars are there for this !!! Brought it two weeks back, Washed once in washing machine and this is what happened. It feels rough. 100% cotton though!!!"
"SICKMUZIC","1.0 out of 5 stars","CHEAPLY MADE OF BOTTOM LINE COTTON MATERIAL ONE WEAR THROW AWAY !!!! SORRY . NEVER HAD GILDAN PRODUCT SO POORLY MADE , EXPLAINS PRICE BREAK ..."
"Wen Y.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I liked these shirts because they are cheap and look nice but OMG I wear one of these shirts under my hoodie and lint was stuck on it (look at the picture). The washer and dryer just made it worst. Would not recommend drying with other shirts or clothes. THIS SHIRT is a Lint Trap"
"Mehmet Aytekin","1.0 out of 5 stars","I had almost not expectations while buying this product yet it still managed to disappoint me. Incredible. Don't buy anyone anything from Gildan. It's like they didn't tailor these for humans. I would like to see a single person that these t-shirts fit well. Just don't buy them. please."

"Ismael","1.0 out of 5 stars","Pre-laundry: The fit appears to be full cut, and not athletic as it appears pictured on Amazon. Fabric is soft and comfortable.
Post laundry: washed in cold water, delicate cycle, dried in dryer, med setting.

"greeg martensite","1.0 out of 5 stars","Thin light weight material. Not the good gildan."
"Tim R.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Ordered these as undershirts for day to day use under dress shirts. The V cut is more of a woman's cut than a man's. The material is ultra thin and comes out of the package feeling like its been used before (picture that commercial where the guy's V looks like a U). It was a good price, but the value's not there. I won't buy again."

This set for whatever reason every single one of them the seam where the V meets by the throat is crooked which then in return make one side of the neck longer than the other. Essentially every shirt is lopsided. I didn’t realize this until it was too late to return."

I am returning them."

"Tee","1.0 out of 5 stars","Way too small. Order your normal size, if not one bigger.
I went on the information I read in other peoples reviews and it was completely wrong. They recommended ordering 1 or 2 sizes down and noted that the shirts out of the packets were very large. I wear a L so ordered S and guess what, they were small! The sizing chart didn't really help either. Such is the risk of guessing sizes and ordering online."
"Johnathan Pearson","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts are all different sizes and the v neck is cut low and awkwardly shaped. I wouldn’t recommend this product."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Strong smell out of the package. Discoloration after only one wash. I've previously purchased this exact pack of shirts before from another retailer. The older shirts look better than these after a single wash."

"Juan Perez","1.0 out of 5 stars","Really underwhelmed by these t shirts quality and fit. Very loose fit, short sleeves (compared to overall size), V neck opening is huge as if the shirt had 200 uses, and the fabric was is not that soft.

"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirt is ruined right after one wash (holes, overall structure integrity) following wash instruction. I only wore them once too, then washed.

"Joey V","1.0 out of 5 stars","Wash them and they are ruined. The shirts become disfigured and fit terrible. They fit great out of the packaging. Will not buy again."
"dhk","1.0 out of 5 stars","It's seems impossible to find a decent t-shirt. It's like nobody cares to to pay attention to what's important. First, the care label it pretty useless and men don't do laundry that way, but it was followed as close as possible. The new shirts were measured against my old Hanes and were over five inches longer. After the first wash and dry on permanent press they shrunk to almost the same size which is too short. Second, the v-neck is not cut right, the t-shirt can be seen when when you wear your top button open on your shirt. They'll make good cleaning rags.
A good t-shirt should not shrink and v-necks should not be seen when the top button on the shirt is open. They should also have practical care instructions and should be able to be washed on hot and dried on high."

"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Bigger than Hanes t shirts. I wish I had of just paid more and got Hanes. The shirts look like they have air in them."
"Dustin G.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Many manufacturers like Hanes, Gildan, and FotL, have transitioned to some weak thread pattern that is not only weak but rough as well. I dislike that I have to pay a premium for a decent shirt, but given the quality, fit, comfort, and softness of the higher-priced shirts are worth 10 of these shirts. I run medium/large and am 5'7"" and the large comes untucked very easily which now makes these shirts my new shop rags. And I wish I were joking."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Something is just not right with these t-shirts. There is no uniform fit from shirt to shirt. There's a really uncomfortable rough texture to the material; several was cycles did not help. Will not be reordering this brand in the future."

As you can see in the picture, there is a small hole in the center of the shirt. Since he has worn all the other shirts already, I am unable to return them."
"JM","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are fine except for being too short. They are a good 3 inches too short for the size, I got XL and they barely reach my belt. I wear all other brands and shirts in XL and never had this problem."

After I washed them, they shrunk so much it is uncomfortable to wear, extremely tight, and way too short.
Never again this brand. Spend a little more and get name brands.
Lesson learned..."
"Shubi","1.0 out of 5 stars","Fits a little small. But after 1 wash even with cold water, and hang drying the tshirts still shrank. But they were still useable.
Recently i was tucking one of the shirt and my finger went through creating a whole... it tore apart in less than 2 months of use.. i have similar undershirts from other companies that have lasted YEARs that did not tear apart or shrink.
GILDAN'S quality is not what it used to be :("
"Danielle D.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered XL for my BF. He wears a lot of golf shirts and usually wears a large. I bought these for him to wear around the house with his jammies but they were way to small. If purchasing, go up 2 sizes from what you would ordinarily buy. Other than than, they are good quality, nice soft t-shirts."
"Amazon_G","1.0 out of 5 stars","The fabric felt like sandpaper and is a lint magnet. The fit was also weird.
Loose on the top and tapered at the bottom. And a little longer then what's needed. Great if you intend to tuck this T-Shirt into your pants like an undershirt to a dress shirt, but defiantly not for casual wear or as a standalone."
"Top 1,000,000th Reviewer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Bought these shirts according to the size chart. I read reviews and even bought a small instead of a medium. The shirts were huge and they came as a medium even though I ordered a small.
I was really looking forward to these shirts for work. Bought the brand before and they were great. Was hoping to get the same satisfactory product. Nope :("
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","THESE SHIRTS ARE NOT SOFT!!!!! They are the scratchiest shirts I have ever felt. I have washed them 3 times already and still feel horrible. They also fit smaller than expected and shrink more after washing. Terrible. Wish I could give them 0 stars! DO NOT BUY!!!!"
"J RYAN","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not impressed extremely wrinkly even for an undershirt. Wash and dryed twice still beyond normal wrinkles. Would have to iron them to get them reasonably out. Weird fitting too super baggy around waste. Wasn’t expecting much for this price but these are bad. Pretty much just bought five work shop rags."
"George Queen","1.0 out of 5 stars","La caja de embalaje llego en buenas condiciones, las playeras vienen selladas dentro de una bolsa de plástico. Hasta aquí todo se veía muy bien, pero cuando saque las playeras de su bolsa note que 2 de ellas tenían 2 perforaciones a la altura de la espalda. por lo cual me decepcione del producto, ademas de que el algodón se siente muy áspero, nada suave. Así que opte por devolver este producto de pésima calidad."
"Hassan","1.0 out of 5 stars","It fits as expected and fabric is nice. However there was no white shirt in the package. My understanding was that there will be 3 black, one grey and one white shirt but instead I got 3 black and 2 grey. The worst part is that one of the grey shirt has a hole in it."
"Stephen A. Day","1.0 out of 5 stars","I am very disappointed in what I got! I went with this V-neck because the picture shows a more athletic fit, AND the actual V of the V-neck part is thinner/not as wide as wide as Fruit of the Loom or Hanes....that is the reason why I ordered these shirts and didn’t just go for the cheaper fruit of the loom or Hanes. I’m sorry but this was pure false advertising. Please correct the photo you have associated with these shirts. Unfortunately I cannot return the ones I got because I was so excited to wear them that I threw them straight into the wash to clean the chemicals out before I wore them. REAL BUMMER!! PS- Please let me know if the actual shirts that are in the photo are available."
"Adriana Cuellar","1.0 out of 5 stars","Me encanta la calidad de Gildan son muy buenos productos... lo malo fue que compré esas camisetas para obsequiar, cuando el festejado abrió el paquete se sorprendió de ver que había caramelo en una de las prendas y venía pegada tela contra tela... me apené bastante, le ofrecí cambiar el producto, pero prefirió decirme que él lavaria la prenda y solucionaria el tema."
"Frank Durnford","1.0 out of 5 stars","Nice color selection that was the only pro
the cons are that after one wash in cold water there was a big shrinkage and would no longer fit. Colour faded. Would not recommend it to anyone."
"Martin","1.0 out of 5 stars","They shrink a whole size after first wash! Also, there are fabric snags everywhere. It nearly fell apart. Not recommendable."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Great fit when first tried on. About 4-5 inches hang past the belt. Decently snug around the body. After 2 washes they are now right on my belt line, sleeves are almost gone and chest is tight. Incredible amount of shrinkage. Order at least 1 size larger."
"PSL","1.0 out of 5 stars","It’s says cotton, but it’s a very itchy “cotton” and they have shrunk in length and I can’t wear them anymore. Very unhappy with this product."

"ZS","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shrunk after one wash on regular wash setting (warm water). The small became XXS. It now fits my son. If you are going to buy this, get at least one size bigger to accommodate for shrinkage."
"Paramvir Khurana","1.0 out of 5 stars","The product should come with a disclosure that it will shrink substantially on the first wash only. Also the threads were coming out from 2 of the 5 shirts from the armpit area- not a good experience. Won’t recommend to buy."

Then after washing and drying, they shrunk to the point where it's ridiculous when I wear them, I can barely put them on. Another ridiculous fact is that under the ''Medium'' tag on the package, there was another one stating they were large. So Gildan has trouble with their sizing management... As for the quality, you can see through the fabric, the white shirt being the worst since I can see the color of my skin through it and my skin is light...It's about 3$ a t-shirt, don't expect much."
