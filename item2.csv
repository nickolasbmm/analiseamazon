"kardude","1.0 out of 5 stars","bad! bad! bad! Very bad quality under-shirts with extremely thin material. All shirts came with defects and loose threads everywhere. Never again any product from Gildan!"
"Ray","1.0 out of 5 stars","Few items to note here. First the cost of these shirts are super cheap so I expected them to not be the greatest quality or to last a super long time either. Figured I would buy these for an upcoming vacation and if they lasted after that, it would be a bonus. Two of the four shirts were not even stitched at the sleeve and one had some threads that if pulled would pull apart the collar stitches. There is a difference being of cheaper quality and not even assembling your product properly to sell. With only one good shirt in the bunch, the deal for 15.00 for four shirts really is 15 for one wearable shirt. Beware as you will get what you pay for here."
"Sean","1.0 out of 5 stars","This set of shirts was pretty affordable and had different colors, making it a must buy for me since I wanted to replace a good portion of my undershirts. Arrived today and I put one one. Fit nice, material was nice, but straight out of the package, one shirt has a very noticeable hole in the shoulder seam. Not entirely sure what happened but I hope the seller contacts me and resolves this."
"Blind Faith 99","1.0 out of 5 stars","So the price was right. Hard to complain when it's $2 a shirt. As it turns out, that's about what they're worth. First thing I noticed was that they're short and wide. They're not tapered as suggested in the description and pictures. It's a one-size-fits-all design. That can really be seen in the neck opening. For the Large size that I got, it's a whopping 11.5 inches in diameter. That means for normal men, it will sit low, causing a lot of neck and back to be exposed, and also, the neckline will be really loose. For comparison, my Jockey t-shirts are 8.5 to 10 inches, and a couple that I got at Target (Merona) are 9 inches. To make matters worse, after one wash, the material along the neckline curled badly. An oversized neck opening with a curled rim is NOT a good look. The shirts are simply unwearable in public. So all 6 immediately go into the rag drawer and I'll use them for painting or other messy jobs where it's okay if the shirt gets ruined. No idea why these shirts are getting good reviews."
"gabbertc","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts say they are 100% Cotten but I don‚Äôt believe I have ever felt such rough scratchy cotton. I have had these shirts for a few weeks now and they have been washed multiple times and are still scratchy. I also put one on this morning and it has a hole in the arm pit. I would not suggest buying these and I will not buy them again."
"Rosie Ortiz","1.0 out of 5 stars","The description of the colors are wrong. Originally ordered two red, one black, one grey and one blue. Received two black, two light gray and one dark gray. Very disappointed. I wanted this set specifically because my boyfriend looks amazing in red and blue. He's my very own Superman!"
"Shawn","1.0 out of 5 stars","One of my shirts came with a big rip on the sleeve seam. Neck seems very tight as well."
"Bob","1.0 out of 5 stars","""Men's Crew T-Shirt"" with 6"" of blouse hanging like a fool, and an absurd toilet bowl seat of a collar -- purposely disguised (downplayed) in the product photos. These might be okay--if you're cool as a ghost pepper n need to shove a pound of cotton in your trousers for that oh so glorious drill sergeant tuck, or you're going to a Halloween party as 1999 Slim Shady--as an undershirt, but unless you're 6'5""+ or very overweight (to compensate for all that material down yonder) yet somehow still have a 42""-44"" chest, then you're going to look completely ridiculous in this clown shirt.
Considering the price point, this is precisely the QC I should've expected from this sorry product -- 'proudly' shelved alongside MainStays goods at WallyWorld. Geez Gildan: I'm done with your company. These are being sent back.
Why should anyone buy these? I guess if you're the type of guy who takes your girl to Arby's for the holidays, then these would make for perfect pajamas to go on your loved one and along with your frugal affairs -- especially when she needs to blast Taco Bell out at 4am the morning after her BDay and there's no time to drop trou.
TL;DR Clown shirt w/ toilet seat for collar."
"Jesse Ellis","1.0 out of 5 stars","Got the shirts because I make custom shirts and pulled it out and undid the tap.. noticed one has a hole in the sleeve"
"Vegas Dweller","1.0 out of 5 stars","Ordered these T-Shirts for winter, they arrived on time. Great, top marks for that, BUT!!
I put one on out of the packet, not so good. I itched all afternoon & evening until I took the damn thing off.
Ok, could be a stupid move on my part to wear something straight out of the pack... Washed T-shirts as we normally do here. No changes in any laundry products, dried on low (some shrinkage not much) used fabric softener AND STILL itchy as all hell.
Put thru on another wash & dry cycle a few days later, put on the T-shirt AND STILL itched all darn day. Tested by wearing one of my ratty old Calvin T-shirts, no itch, no problem. There is definitely something wrong with my batch of T-shirts, sending them back. Watch out you may just end up with some of these T-shirts, not worth the low price or the high aggravation. See these & move on to the next one...."
"t(^__^t)","1.0 out of 5 stars","5'11"" ; 155lbs ; size: medium
I don't think I've ever hated a shirt more in my life. I don't think I've ever hated any shirt before, actually.. But these shirt are exceptionally garbage. I put one on right out of the package; it was too big. 100% cotton, it'll shrink. Lit.
Washed and dried them all, and I'm writing this after wearing each of them once. Overall, I am like.. angry at these shirts. I mean it. These shirts suck so bad that I just want to kick something small and defenseless to let off some steam. Every single collar shrunk and is too tight, but the back still manages to hang down uncomfortably far. And I have a decently thin neck. I think it's like 15 inches, iirc. I've never worn a medium and thought the collar was too tight. Every medium I've ever bought has fit me; some better than others, sure, but this is my first time ever writing a passionate review ABOUT SHIRTS. Anyway, the sleeves poke straight out‚Äîlike little goblin ears, right at the bottom of your shoulder muscle. And speaking of shoulders, the top of the sleeve, where the seams meet up.. that's like 0.75"" away from where it should be. AND LASTLY (I hate Gildan so much for forcing me to write such a long review; I'm busy, I don't wanna be doing this, but you forced my hand Gildan, you son of a bitch. You made such a terrible shirt that I felt FORCED to make time to let you know that I hate you and everyone else who was involved in the process of making these shirts), the bottom seam flips up. 6 our of 6 shirts, I could not make that bottom seam lay flat for more than 30 seconds.
Love,
Jon
P.S. Gildan, the fact that you thought I might enjoy any aspect of any of these shirts is offensive to me, and I consider it SIGNIFICANTLY disrespectful that you thought my standards were so low. I will fight you in a parking lot just to preserve my honor. Also, I'm not even going to donate these to Goodwill; poor people are honestly just better off naked."
"Jpm99g","1.0 out of 5 stars","Beware go to the website for Gildan crew t-shirts or just look at the picture here.. I received stitching falling out of shirts almost transparent can see right through them the real shirts from this website picture show the name tags embroidered. The one I received has hanging tags looks like it came from a fleamarket not factory sealed in a bag and was just thrown in a shipping bag all dusty wrapped up in a ball.. $25 better off buying Haynes."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Well I usually buy from your site and have good things to say. However this time I‚Äôm not so happy, first the shirts you had sent aren‚Äôt even Gildan shirts, they are some random shirts you got, that don‚Äôt even have a name. They are suppose to be tagless however again disappointed. The material is cheap and not worth the price I paid! I‚Äôm sorry I have to choice a new place to buy from, as I have bought from you numerous times. ‚òπÔ∏èüò§"
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Okay let me start by saying the tshirts feel nice and fit the body well. My biggest complaint is the sleeves. They are missing about 2 inches in length. Looks ridiculous so now they are for bed. I say if your looking for a casual tshirt to wear with jeans or chinos... do not buy these shirts. Save your money or spend a little more and buy good shirts such as Calvin Klein or Tommy. But you can‚Äôt compare this brand to those so again...if these are for leisure around the house or bed then they may be for you. In my opinion not for jeans and tshirt day. Again this only my opinion and these may be a great fit/look for some, but not for me!"
"BM","1.0 out of 5 stars","I always wash my clothes in cold water and dry with very low heat to minimize any shrinkage. These shirts shrank so bad i can't even tuck them into my pants! I have other t-shirts made by Gildan that do not shrink but I would stay away from these unless you wash in cold water and air dry your t-shirts! I realize these are cheap but i have similar cheap Hanes t-shirts that barely shrink after washing and drying."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Took one out and tried in on when I received them. Felt a little small for a medium. Ia'm 5'10"" and 170 lbs. The biggest concern was the fabric. The label says 100% cotton. If it's cotton it has to the lowest grade of cotton. Fells like you are wearing burlap [very itchy]. Decided to wash all 6 in cold water to see if the itchiness would improve. They still are very itchy! They are really like you are wearing burlap! Also after washing them they have shrunk. I feel the collar on the front of my neck and they are also now tight in the arm pits. I have decided to use them for RAGS!"
"W Burt","1.0 out of 5 stars","Bought 1 size large (XL) planning on some minimal shrinkage on washing. Tried them on before laundering, black were noticeably longer than gray, but all were ok. Washed once in cold water, dried permanent press low heat setting. All shirts were at least 2"" shorter after laundering, and no longer are wearable for me. Missed return window, but won't be ordering this product again, unless it's in a tall size (which isn't offered on Amazon). Too bad, as they're a great weight to wear under a sweater this time of year."
"Kenny","1.0 out of 5 stars","I found the sleeve cuff stitching to be very scratchy and irritated the areas around by biceps. Collar was fairly rough as well.
You're definitely buying cheapest on the market with this product, but keep in mind it's at the cost of any reminiscence of comfort.
I bought a shirt from two other fairly cheaper brands (about $7 a shirt) and they were MUCH more comfortable. If you can afford that, get one or two of those other brands instead."
"shopgirl76","1.0 out of 5 stars","I'm really annoyed (to put it politely) at what a complete waste of money these were. I bought these for my husband and they shrank so badly in the wash that it's not even funny. And that's before you realize that, as others have commented, they're basically see-through - so who was the genius (sarcasm!!) who through about massively printing the company name in bright blue on the back???
Waste of money, would NOT recommend. You're better off buying this stuff at Walmart."
"A U","1.0 out of 5 stars","after a few months of owning these, they have stretched out to the point they look and fit like an XXL. And i ordered mediums. They are not slim cut at all, wearing a sail would be more for form fitting. Don't buy, listen to all the recent reviews. I'm severely disappointed."
"kardude","1.0 out of 5 stars","bad! bad! bad! Very bad quality under-shirts with extremely thin material. All shirts came with defects and loose threads everywhere. Never again any product from Gildan!"

"Kindle Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","I was looking for high quality t-shirts and ordered these based upon Amazon reviews. The reviews are wrong. I have a short torso, and these t-shirts run short, so the t-shirt is always escaping from belt and I have to tuck it in. Also, I was expecting a heavy-weight cotton t, but instead this is a thin, light-weight t. All in all, it's pretty uncomfortable.
These shirts were so uncomfortable, I finally wound up throwing them out, replacing them with Fruit of the Loom Stay Tucked In t shirts. The FOL shirts **really** stay tucked in."
"Peter T. Szymonik","1.0 out of 5 stars","So these are perhaps the worst t-shirts I've ever bought. On the plus side, the material is all cotton and feels good. On the downside, their cut is all wrong and if you wonder if a human being tried them on. The neck hole is too small and will choke you, the sleeves are too short and the front of the shirt is longer than the back - making you feel like you're wearing it backwards! (And I have a very normal body.)"
"Thomas K.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I don‚Äôt typically write reviews.
But feel compelled as this is a horrible quality product.
I don‚Äôt know where they sourced the cotton on this. But it gets worse wash after wash.
The Denier, or density of thread - a unit of measure for the linear mass density of fibers.
In simple terms level of quality. Think 400 thread count sheets vs. 1500.
I wouldn‚Äôt use these T-Shirts even as rags in my garage as they will scratch what ever I wipe with it.
The collar materials is even worse. They actually created rub/skin tags on my neck. And yes. I use Name brand Laundry Detergent (Persil) and Fabric Softener (Downy) on a Front load washing machine.
I decided to try these instead of my go to ‚ÄúKirkland Signature‚Äù brand. What an unfortunate experiment.
The Kirkland held together for longer than expected, didn‚Äôt pit, and didn‚Äôt get holes. The more I washed, the softer they became.
If you have skin of steel and $10 bucks to waste. Go for it."
"D. Platt","1.0 out of 5 stars","Ordered because these shirts were listed as being made from polyester. However, they are 100% cotton and I CANNOT use them for sublimation.
Very disappointed and will have to return."
"michael harris","1.0 out of 5 stars","I love this brand of t-shirts however they have tarnished their name with this line. I regret ordering these. They are so thin they can't be worn. I will use them for rags. Shame on Gildan for putting these out there. Trust me do not buy these."
"S Do","1.0 out of 5 stars","At first, I like the material, they're comfortable just like the more expensive ones.
However, they quickly become not very usable after a few washes because they shrunk 1 size down.
I don't want to return them since I already washed them, but I'm quite disappointed."
"jwel","1.0 out of 5 stars","Who can rate comfort, softness, and moisture-wicking when this T-shirt shrinks one size in a Gentle, Cold-water washer and a dryer set at Delicate-Cool? On first inspection, they appeared small and were tight-fitting; after being laundered, way too small to fit. Nice theory; poor practice."
"robert sherman","1.0 out of 5 stars","I am very disappointed with this product. I followed all of the directions to iron it onto my tshirts and it did not work at all. The paper was very difficult to get off and when it did come off it ripped in half and ruined my shirt. I couldn't even get it all off. The design was ruined and I could not fix it. I will not be buying this product again."
"Robert F Jermano","1.0 out of 5 stars","This was the first time I bought a Gildan product.
The product was delivered before the given delivery date (a plus). I opened the package and tried on a T-shirt for fit and it felt great, just right - length, shoulders, armpit, etc. So, I put the T's in the washer (cold) with other similar colors, normal wash and dry process. When I removed from the dryer to fold they looked significantly smaller so I tried one on. They don't fit anymore! They shrunk so much they are not long enough to tuck in my pants and are very tight around the armpit stitch. Unwearable! Please be forewarned: if you buy this product make sure you order at one or two sizes larger. I would recommend going with Hanes, Fruit or another brand."
"Hal","1.0 out of 5 stars","So. I ordered these shirts. It is not possible to return them, at least not in the normal sense. They were sent via Fed Ex. I realized I ordered the wrong size and IMMEDIATELY tried to cancel the order. I've been waiting on an ""email"" from ""FANTASTICAL GROUP"" that will theoretically allow me to get my $36 back.
I am zero happy."
"M","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these shirts because it is a brand we have been buying and love. But unlike all of our other Gildan shirts, these shrunk and took lint in the dryer and feel thin and cheap. I was expecting the same quality we had before from Gildan of the strong long lasting cotton, and these shirts felt like dollar store quality."
"Dana Ryan","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these for my bf and they are horrible. I just washed them and they shrunk like a whole size and the stitching is coming undone. He didn‚Äôt even wear them yet. I wanted to wash them 1st before he did. I will definitely not buy any other shirts like these. Why is it so hard to find a nice t shirt for a man?"
"Jeremy Adams","1.0 out of 5 stars","I don't leave many reviews on products, especially bad ones, but I feel morally obligated to warn people about these shirts. They are terrible. If they're actually made from cotton as they claim, it must have been from the absolutely worst part of the cotton plant (or maybe the dirt they were planted in?). I ordered two sets and decided to risk washing one of them to see if they would soften up. They didn't. They literally feel like sandpaper. If you're someone who has sensitive skin issues (eczema, dermatitis, allergies, or whatever) and are looking for an inexpensive cotton shirt, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE."
"Peter","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have purchased the same product previously and they were great, this most recent purchase of Ten shirts for some reason are four inches longer then before? No where on the order do they say big & tall or designed to tick in...
Irritating waste of money. Description should say dress & not t shirt imo"
"J & S","1.0 out of 5 stars","Ordered these as under shirts for work and they significantly shrunk after the first wash/dry. I see this as poor quality, but if you still want to buy get at least the next size up. For me, this is throw away and I'll be going back to non discount brands.
For reference I am 6'2"" weigh 200lbs and ordered a large"
"Mario","1.0 out of 5 stars","These can only be used once. Once you wash them they start to discolor and have a weird yellow tint to them and once dried they shrink."
"Svitlana","1.0 out of 5 stars","After one wash the stitching came undone. Very disappointed."
"Tony B.","1.0 out of 5 stars","After ONE wash, the shirts had holes, seriously, as if the shirts were 10 years old. Will not purchase here again"
"Kevin & Liz","",""
"Kevin","1.0 out of 5 stars","Bought 2 sets of these 12 total shirts. Here we are a month later and two of then the seams are coming undone. I use them as under shirts and they feel great. But i'd expect them to last longer then a month. Return date closed 2 days ago and now im stuck with shirts that arent lasting. Thats why the 1 star rating. Had i been able to exchange them. I probably would have given these a 4 star.."
"Glenn Marsh","1.0 out of 5 stars","i prefer a fitted t-shirt that is soft and comfortable. these are not comfortable, soft or fitted. because they're 100% cotton after they're washed they look crinkled and there's no way i'm ironing a t-shirt. maybe as an undershirt, these would be ok. these t-shirts are donated to the goodwill."
"Chase","1.0 out of 5 stars","Worn this maybe thrice and found a hole. Would not buy again. Would urge others not to either."
"David Lipka","1.0 out of 5 stars","Didn‚Äôt see any reviews that talked about how much the shirts shrink when washed. These shrunk from XL to close to medium. Where the arms fit fine out of the package, they converted into unwearable after washing. Very disappointed."
"Bobby","1.0 out of 5 stars","I like buying these shirts they fit great and last along time ...but 3 were missing out of a 5 pack and they barely reimbursed me...
EDIT: I ordered another 5 pack. said delayed everyday for a week saying it will be delivered the next day. so i finally just canceled the order. too bad these are awesome shirts will have to find a different brand!"
"Margaret","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are a sorry excuse for workout shirts, they are way thicker fabric than any gym shirt I've bought and they wrinkle so bad in the wash that I cant even wear them outside its embarrassing. Guess you get what you pay for, going to use them as work undershirts instead at least that way they are hidden from view. Sigh."
"Troy Hayden","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shirt length shrunk up after 1st wash. Barely below belt line...unwearable. usually have good experience with gildan products...bummed. should have bought 2xlt"
"Pete Milah","1.0 out of 5 stars","Poor fit. Picture shows a tapered body but these shirts fit like a bag. Sleeves do not fit well either."
"Monica","1.0 out of 5 stars","While I don't like writing bad revues because I understand it hurts the business, this was a must as I tried to resolve this by calling the customer service.
We bought several packs at once for our small business. the shirts are so low quality, they will start tearing up during the first wear in seams followed by the holes all over the products.
Their customer service is also bad.
The representative followed the script and asked me to send pictures of the damages so they could decide if I can get a replacement of their terrible product. No thanks."
"End User","1.0 out of 5 stars","Upon receipt these tees were laundered together with tees of two other brands (Costco's Kirkland and Fruit of the Loom). The tees from the ""two other brands"" are fine: They retained their thickness, shape and feel. The Gildans, on the other hand, feel ""old."" That is, they lost body and shape and resemble shirts that have been laundered many, many times. Never had a product do this before. My recommendation: Buy anything else. There isn't a significant price difference but quality-wise..............Wow!"
"Tom","1.0 out of 5 stars","i have worn this twice and the stitching is already falling apart. Totally unacceptable. I would not recommend anybody purchases these given how fast they fall apart. I will contact seller and let you know if they stand behind their product."
"Bob D","1.0 out of 5 stars","Such a shame. They fit great and look good - but 2 of the 5 shirts have holes in them right out of the package. If they can't hold up out of the factory - a few trips through the washing machine will probably finish them."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Received my order of these shirts and tried one on. The fit was somewhat snug, though that is how I generally like my t-shirt to fit. Washed them following the care instructions before wearing and they shrunk terribly. Not the usual first-time-washed shrinkage. No. I'm talking down two sizes shrinkage. Sleeves turned into cap sleeves they were so short, and the shirt itself didn't even reach my belt line. Really disappointed with how this turned out because I can't even return them since they've been washed.
Buy a size larger than usual, at least, if you're purchasing some of these."
"Joshua Osborne","1.0 out of 5 stars","I really dislike how much these shrink after one wash. I have bought many different kind of undershirts before and have never seen this sort of shrinkage before. They are very uncomfortable at the armpits and rise to almost above waistline after it. Overall, seems like meh quality and the shrinking makes them almost unwearable."
"Keving","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shrinkbup about 2 full sizes when washing! Forget about trying to get the massive wrinkles out as well, no chance! May be ok under other shirts, but no good if you intend to wear it alone!"
"matt owen","1.0 out of 5 stars","The description promised a fabric that would feel soft. It couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. I‚Äôve opened the packet, tried one on and will never put it on again. Proportions not as expected, material fairly course for a cotton material and all round too big for an under layer."
"Abian","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shirt quality is horrible. Fits very loose like i just got out of a shirt pulling party. If your looking for a fitted shirt these aren't it. Plus they strink tremendously after a couple washes"
"j","1.0 out of 5 stars","I am having trouble replacing these tshirts. 3 of the 6 of the T-shirt‚Äôs have a hole in the armpit of the shirt. It appears to have missed the sewing.
They fit well and have good material I just want a replacement for the ones with holes.
?"
"Sarah","1.0 out of 5 stars","I thought these would be a great deal but the cut on them is horrible. They pinch in the arm pits and are tight on the chest but very loose in the belly. If you‚Äôve ever done any pushups or pulls up and don‚Äôt have a bear gut, look elsewhere"
"Kerry Logan","1.0 out of 5 stars","Seams ripping apart under the arms. I am a field service engineer and my work is not hard on clothing, as it would be for a carpenter or construction worker. These shirts can't handle just regular wear and laundry."
"Steven Clarkq","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shirts gave me a rash. Not 100% cotton. Threw them all in the rag pile. Can't wear them. Must be some kind of blend. The material lable is a lie. That's what I get for buying the cheapest shirts on Amazon.."
"jerilynnferg","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts shrunk significantly after one wash in cold and one dry on low. What a complete waste of money and I made the mistake of buying multiple packs thinking I could rely on what I thought was a quality brand name. The large now fit like medium or small. Completely unwearable for my husband."
"Jhin","1.0 out of 5 stars","you cant even just wear this casually and go out. looks like ur wearing one piece or something. fit is so bad everything is so loose you dnt even look good. I had the right size but its just the way it looks make u look like you are in 1990s LOL"
"J","1.0 out of 5 stars","I got these before and they were much better quality. The neck gets all loose and nasty looking throughout the day. Bacon neck Supreme. Won't buy again."
"Michael","1.0 out of 5 stars","I washed these and wore them once and they have holes in the arms. Do yourself a favor and listen to all of the awful reviews on this product. This is the first bad review I have ever had to write on a product I ordered from amazon. Very poor quality, stick with Hanes or anything else."
"GoEasyMan","1.0 out of 5 stars","Great price, average quality BUT THREE shirts came with a hole in this same spot. Had to be a manufacturing defect as it did not penetrate through the back and was on at least 3 shirts. DO NOT BUY!!!"
"Becca","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these for my husband and he got 1 use out of them. We were initially happy because they seem to be long enough. Then we washed them, and even hung them dry to prevent additional shrinking. They are belly shirts on him now. the moment he barely lifts his arms you can see his belly button. Not purchasing again."
"William K. Wiley","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have had many Gildan shirts in the past that were great quality. These are NOT! I tried both Large and X Large and had to send them back. I normally wear a large in just about every other T-shirt. The larges are more like mediums. The Large and X Large are very short in the length. They do not stay tucked in. They do not hold their shape. The collars are horrible. This is not a quality product!"
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts were so bad I had to return them. The first thing I noticed was the 100% cotton did not feel like cotton at all. It felt much more like polyester. Still I thought I would try them on and it only got worse from there. The sleeves were sewn too far back and I felt a constant tugging at my shoulders. No matter how I tried I could not make it comfortable, although I will say it was better when I tried them on backwards. It just took a few minutes to figure out I had to return them. I will say Amazon made it easy to return and I promptly got the return credit."
"Michael M","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts shrank unbelievably on first wash. Out of package, the length was well below belt line. After initial wash, they were barely at belt line. There is no way these shirts would stay tucked in underneath my dress shirts. And these were washed cold, 15 min. damp dried then hung up."
"Love to teach","1.0 out of 5 stars","Thin material. I usually buy the Kirkland brand from Costco, they are probably twice as thick as these. Will not buy these again.
9/11/18: Update: They get worse as you wash them. These shirts embody all the things I hate about cheap undergarments. Fabric stretches weird ways, they do not stay uniform."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","This set of shirts was great until I washed them. They went from a large to a small/extra small. There is no way to avoid this. They were washed in cold water. Just cheap. I guess I need to pay the extra $ for better quality. They are unusable after 3 washes because of how much they have shrunk. Buy Hanes instead"
"Jesse M","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have no idea when companies decided that undershirts needed to be long enough that you could use it as a dress but for some reason all these shirts are entirely too long."
"Jason Hale","1.0 out of 5 stars","Package came today, the bag the shirts were in was completely torn open at the top. One of the shirts has blue stains around the collar and all over the chest, in addition to a few small brown spots near the collar and right shoulder. Very disappointed."
"Dave Curtis","1.0 out of 5 stars","Four reasons not to buy these t-shirts: They run very small; an XL fits like a tight large. The sleeves are very short. They will shrink when you wash them. The neck, while nicely finished, is uncomfortable. As my wife says, ""You get what you pay for."""
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts were not a bright white color when washed they formed a yellow color and shrunk to the point where they cannot be worn. Very disappointed and not worthy to order ever again."
"Terry henson","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these shirts online because i could no longer find at wal mart bought the same size that i bought at the store and they fit very differently ! I use them as undershirts for work now i look sloppy because they hang way below my work shirts and i loved them specifically for the reason that they were not long and i bought 2 packs of 6 thats 12 shirts i reall hate and im stuck with them now please send me the xl that are short in length and i will send back the ones that im disappointed with but gildans are great other wise"
"SteveX82","1.0 out of 5 stars","Does not come in the colors indicated - received various shades of gray, instead. I ended up returning them."
"Christ T. Kazias","1.0 out of 5 stars","If you want threads coming out of your sleeves, then this is the T to purchase.
Very unhappy with the quality and the T's are very thin in material."
"B J","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these for my husband. Straight out of the package, shirts had holes in them. Wouldn't recommend at all. These are a waste of money."
"brian w.","1.0 out of 5 stars","As other reviews stated these things look as if they are made my union workers in America. They are very low quality with loose strings everywhere. I will never buy Gildan again. Too many other options out there."
"Daniel Boss","1.0 out of 5 stars","Cheap quality becomes too tight to wear after first wash. But hey.. you get what you pay for. Ain‚Äôt buying shirts these cheap anymore. Learned my lesson. Will waste more $ in the long haul buying cheap shirts rather than more expensive shirts with superior quality (that actually stretch) instead of shrink"
"Larry","1.0 out of 5 stars","This shirt is way to short and the material is poor quality. Shrinks a lot when you wash it and only lasts too wear a handful of times. The worst part is the collar it stretches and wrinkles horribly."
"Dahlia Stokell","1.0 out of 5 stars","I purchased these in July and now in October, just three months later they are falling apart! Not worn for work or abused in any way. So they are just very cheaply made and poor quality."
"Auzzy","1.0 out of 5 stars","Tight at the top, loose at the bottom, short, and crap material. If you're not short and wide, probably won't work for you."
"Mary J. Pratt","1.0 out of 5 stars","First of all I expected a brand of shirt that I knew but got these instead.
I washed and dried them to see how they were, after all it's just a white T-shirt.
They were so twisted and out of shape when they came out of the dryer that I couldn't even fold them.
The knit fabric did not lay flat at all.
A big disappointment. Good only for night shirts... or dusting."
"p.ferguson","1.0 out of 5 stars","So gildan was always good it‚Äôs a shame . I would have returned but need shirts fast . I say no ... poor quality."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Bad quality packing, bad quality t-shirt, dirty product. Packed like a ham. Returning, and reconsidering Amazon as my e-commerce website. Full of unknown brands with poor quality products and too many fake knock-offs."
"D&B","1.0 out of 5 stars","Material is suspect. It stretches out and loses its shape. I‚Äôm not happy. I‚Äôve had them for 10 months or so. Fits good, but I won‚Äôt buy again"
"Moe-Money-Moe-Problems","1.0 out of 5 stars","Don't waste your money. They're cheap. The waistline is too wide. Does not fit well at all. It also washes up terribly"
"Buendia/Brinton","1.0 out of 5 stars","I got my shirts with holes in them! Super upset cause my only option it so return but i just want to exchange the damaged shirt but of course the price is 3x more now...... DONT BUY!"
"N.M.","1.0 out of 5 stars","They run a bit smallish, but it costs $5 to send them back, then about 3 weeks to get the refund.
Order a size up."
"Bluefin","1.0 out of 5 stars","I would have returned these but needed to use them. The material isn't like any Gildan T-shirt I've had in the past, which was always substantial and long lasting. These are much thinner and flimsy material. Already getting holes and stretching out after a few washes."
"Randy F.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Ordered these from Amazon a few months ago. I have 2 of the 6 left. I am expecting about one or two more wears out of them. These T Shirts are out of inferior material that does not hold up to washing. I have rated these T Shirts accordingly and are disposable. While the fit and style are satisfactory, the durability is unsatisfactory. i would avoid these unless you are looking for a cheap single-use T Shirt. Buyer Beware!"
"Thatguy","1.0 out of 5 stars","I wear T shirt daily after the description I was expecting a softer feel. After washing they all( a pack V neck and regular) turned into just regular T shirt."
"Mickel mobley","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these shirts to wear to a function tonight and im glad there is more than one of them in the pack because two of them have black ink spots on them like magic marker spots. I would return them all but I need one to wear under my dress shirt tonight to dinner. I paid for 6 white tee shirts and got 4 so I am not happy at all with this product."
"Eva","1.0 out of 5 stars","Missing 1 shirt, and the shirts were not in package they were just placed in a box. Theses shorts were a gift and look like the we‚Äôre used"
"LoveMyKansas","1.0 out of 5 stars","There were snags that made holes in the shirts... i had already inked on the shirt before I saw them so no returning :("
"Lord Helmet","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts shriveled up like a witch in the rain after one wash. These shirts are absolute garbage."
"Patrick","1.0 out of 5 stars","Bought these based on the recommended size. They fit well until i washed them. They are not pre-washed so they went down a complete size. I recommend ordering a size up. Wash first to see if they fit. Construction is standard for a 3 dollar shirt.
(Rating is low to warn people)"
"Operaguy","1.0 out of 5 stars","Disappointed. I'm a size 40. M is too small, L is too big. Too short. Sleeves ridiculously short. Scratchy, thin fabric. Threw them out. Costco Kirkland brand are a revelation that I highly recommend."
"Laura R","1.0 out of 5 stars","Received shirts with MULTIPLE hole areas before he was even able to wear them. Its wear and tear on shirts that should have been brand new. I am very disappointed with my service. I have several pictures."
"cortes","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are of poor quality. I always was items before wearing them but I do try them on first. I can tell you that after washing them, they lost their shape and started to fade."
"T. Westhoff","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered a 12 pack and got a 6 pack. They look thick. I am not happy about paying for a 12 pack and only getting a 6 pack."
"W. I.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I thought I am getting a good deal. When I got them, I checked them before, and looked very big for Large size. Put them in the washer, and then dried them to see if they get shrunk, however, they became very wrinkled and feels very hard. Completely different from my other cotton crew t-shirts. Never again."
"Kerlin","1.0 out of 5 stars","Very disappointed on these shirts , I bought these Shirts size medium for my husband and I washed them before he could wear them this shirt shrunk so badly to a 10 years old kid size shirts. I even used cold water on them and (dry) delicate They still shrunk."
"JWP","1.0 out of 5 stars","When new the shirt was fine not great but okay for an undershirt. After three washes shirts had shorten and would no longer stay tucked in.
These will but cut into rags before end of the year."
"King Pea","1.0 out of 5 stars","Just a warning. Shirts are long at bottom and sleeve. Also all shirts were creased. Unless you wash and iron or get their good stack items I would not buy. Not like the ones at Wal-Mart ... Though that might be on good days that I purchased perfect shirts. Bad ones the whole store gets wrecked. Literally every clothes item"
"Bob","1.0 out of 5 stars","Great t-shirt. Great fit. Until you wash it a couple of times. They shrink in the length and in the sleeves. I would not repeat the purchase"
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","When the shirts came in they fit great. Once I washed them on the delicate cycle with cold water (I do with all my black clothes) and dried on delicate they shrunk still and already faded. Will not recommend these shirts. Feel like I wasted my money"
"Shawnda thomas","1.0 out of 5 stars","It‚Äôs not a true black looking color it looks more of a dark blue and once you iron it it looks very dull looking and it attracts a lot of lint"
"OJ*NYC","1.0 out of 5 stars","Size M doesn't fit right. It is much looser --especially at chest-- than any other T shirt from other brands I bought before. Also, the quality is below average -- too thin. Finally, the shirts come all wrinkled out of a very cheap plastic package. Quite disappointing purchase. The only positive is the tagless label, but it doesn't offset all the negatives."
"CITLP","1.0 out of 5 stars","The material is comfortable but one wash later and it shrinks more than a dick in a ice bath"
"RMV","1.0 out of 5 stars","Cloth is transparent . May be used as Inner cloth. Not good for outdoor . Not a good quality as expected. Not due how it got so many good reviews"
"Dan","1.0 out of 5 stars","Decent disposable shirts before the covid inflation pricing I bought 12 pack for under $16."
"michael Gais","1.0 out of 5 stars","The second purchase didn't fit the same as the first order. The first order fit correctly, so I reordered the same shirts, but they were too long. The chest is the same size but the length is way below the belt."
"Michael","1.0 out of 5 stars","This was my second time ordering this product. This shipment was worst than the first. Items look to be worn and filthy"
"Sarah McCann","1.0 out of 5 stars","The ad is for water wicking sport shirts. These are nothing but basic cotton shirts.
NOT HAPPY"
"Allison Yeo","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are pretty bad. They‚Äôre thin, the ink for the tag are faded and like to rub off. I bought the small and the medium packs and the smalls aren‚Äôt even made of cotton. They‚Äôre polyester lol. I‚Äôve bought gildan shirts in brick and mortar stores before. They‚Äôve never been the best quality shirts but these aren‚Äôt even worth the slightly lower price. I‚Äôm fairly certain these are fake."
"F.corlier","1.0 out of 5 stars","I washed them before wearing them the first time. when they came back from the laundry they were all crooked and deformed. That's not a quality product.I'd rate these T-shirts as 'disposable'."
"Agility","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts are bad quality, and you can't return them because they come in 1-time packaging (that you have to break)."
"Trevor Pedersen","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts aren't worth the 4.5/5 star rating they've gotten. The quality is as cheap as the price. The fabric is extremely rough and itchy, the collars are poorly fitted (kinda looks like a wavy piece of bacon), and don't expect a muscular fitting like the photos would suggest."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","You get what you pay for. This shirts are definitely made cheap and not soft at all. I wanted them as undershirts for work but even that isn‚Äôt comfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt buy these shirts again. I‚Äôm not sure how they are rated so high."

"Lori","1.0 out of 5 stars","The kirkland shirts are thicker, more comfortable, and shrink resistant. These shirts blow."
"Tyler williams","1.0 out of 5 stars","Terrible shirts. The sleeves were stretched so much. It looked goofy. And then when I washed them the shrunk so much a child couldn't were them. All around it was a waste of money I will never get back."
"Kakalaka Rebels","1.0 out of 5 stars","Opened it. Put it on. Removed it. Put it to donation box.
The fit it terrible. It is very tight on the neck and biceps, but is very loose and baggy over all. Very unflattering fit. I have an average body, can not even imagine what it would look like on a fit person. I would not recommend. Save your money, look elsewhere."
"RON","1.0 out of 5 stars","WORST SHIRT I'VE EVER PURCHASED. MUST BE IRONED UNLESS YOU PREFER THE SEERSUCKER LOOK ANS THE FEEL IS TERRIBLE"
"Rick","1.0 out of 5 stars","Ordered large, received size small. Price was to good to be true. Product used for rags."

"Regina Butler","1.0 out of 5 stars","I am very dissatisfied. All of the shirts have tiny pin holes on them. My first purchase that I'm unhappy about."
"beezuss","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are made from the cheapest, roughest, thinnest cotton I have ever worn. They fit very small in the shoulders with the sleeves riding way up. I really hate these shirts."
"Gabe Lind","1.0 out of 5 stars","Honestly, don‚Äôt get this. Don‚Äôt shop online. The shirt was a bit larger than I expected, but I was not upset as I planned to shrink it with a wash. However, when I put it on, it was grainy and practically see through. It isn‚Äôt great at fulfilling the role it should. Unlikely that I‚Äôll wear this unless it‚Äôs the last shirt I have to wear while doing laundry."
"Jailain Hollon","1.0 out of 5 stars","I brought these t-shirts simply to wear around the house Or working out if nothing else, but even though they were new the the black color was a little faded. I didn‚Äôt mind that since they were just for wearing around the house and working out but after 1 wash cycle they shrunk down to a medium and now they don‚Äôt fit. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
"Iwan","1.0 out of 5 stars","This products is wrongly advertised and gives you the impression of a good fit but in reality it‚Äôs too big at the sleeves(and I go to the gym regularly).
It‚Äôs also has a poor finish - not surprising considering it‚Äôs low price but didn‚Äôt expect strings of wool as I took out the shirt."
"jri","1.0 out of 5 stars","These t-shirts are not worth buying they fit ok and by that I mean a little below the waist. Wich is ok but after the first wash and I didn't place in dryer. They shrink above the waist. The first thing that you will notice when you pull them out of the bag is that these tshirts are paper thin . Total garbage!!!!!"
"TSanta","1.0 out of 5 stars","Pretty rough Feeling cotton. The collar is extremely uncomfortable and presses into my chest. That‚Äôs right, these shirts have a sewn on ribbed collar which irritates my skin."
"Christy","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered x large for my husband normally that is his size but it was way to big. And one of the shirts had a stane"
"Adontai","1.0 out of 5 stars","tHese shirts look good for basic tees and the fit though a little loose was decent. They didn't however hold up well after wearing and washing one or two times."
"Bucky Goldstein","1.0 out of 5 stars","One of the shirts had a 3 inch long hole along the seam in the sleeve. Terrible first impression."
"M. T. Smith","1.0 out of 5 stars","False advertising. Said in the description synthetic material for wicking. What I DIDN'T want was 100 percent cotton t-shirts. I'm returning them, but now I'm afraid to reorder again because I will probably get the same product. Very disappointing. I am sick of sending stuff back and waiting for refunds to appear back in my account."
"Jeff","1.0 out of 5 stars","They fit as expected when I got them, but have continued to shrink, despite running them in the dryer on low heat. They've shrunk to the point where I'm going to be uncomfortable all day, which has prompted me to write this review. I feel like I'm in a straight jacket."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","The discription is deceiving. I assumed I was getting black and gray tops instead they sent bright red tops with one black shirt. Poor quality. I will not order from them again!!!"
"John Aiken","1.0 out of 5 stars","I‚Äôve been an Amazon customer for twenty year. This is the first time I felt deceived by a description. These t-shirts are not synthetic. They are not moisture wicking. They are all cotton. When washed, they shrunk so much the xl size came above my waist. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù.
I expect to believe a lede description on Amazon. I should not be expected to read verbose corrections at the bottom."
"Koa","1.0 out of 5 stars","The material is coarse, uncomfortable and scratchy. I suppose one gets what one paid for."

"Dr. E","1.0 out of 5 stars","I wrote in a previous review that these Gildan Crew T-Shirts were great. I have now discovered after two washings that the collar turns down and presents a sloppy image. I am very disappointed. I was looking for a shirt that did not fold down."
"Annie","1.0 out of 5 stars","This is my second attempt to order some basic shirts for my son. I ordered L the first time, 1 of 5 fit and the others were small. Next I ordered XL, all were smaller than the one L that had fit from the previous order. There is apparently no quality control on sizes- even in the same package."

"On Time","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not what they use to be for sure, not soft, loose threads and larger than before. Not happy!"
"Tonya Stoffel","1.0 out of 5 stars","The colors change colors fast, my man was running a few times with his shirts and the colors changed in his armpits. Never had that,happen before when we purchased but this shipment it did really bad. And the shirts were all different sizes. They all said xl, but a couple were longer and shorter and wider."
"Megan Bruno","1.0 out of 5 stars","The picture is NOT accurate. They make the shirts look snug as undershirts should. These are humongous. I bought for my boyfriend to use as undershirts and I'm going to give them to my Pop who has a significant old man belly. He will love these as regular shirts but these are not undershirts unless you buy 2 sizes too small"
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shrunk after first wash and bit too tight for my liking."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","At first I thought the shirts were nice. Good weight and soft. However, the second time I washed it, I found a hole.

"Mike Splane","1.0 out of 5 stars","These showed up in a Fed Ex bag today (no inner bag) so I was immediately skeptical. Pulled them out.....um yeah. The fabric was old-ish looking (pilly) and had threads hanging everywhere from stitching. Horrible sewing quality. Then the icing on the cake is that they were 2 sizes too large. I ordered mediums and these could easily be X-Large. I've been burned on Chinese counterfeits for T-Shirts on Amazon twice in a row now. Never again."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts seemed ok upon initial review. Slightly longer than the Hanes my husband was used to- but this was great because they stayed tucked in better. However, the second time we washed them they turned completely yellow. The whole shirt. The rest of the whites in our load came out perfect. Weird. We don‚Äôt use anything strange. Just gain detergent. I‚Äôve never had this happen before."
"David T.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I strongly dislike it when products misrepresent themselves. The pictures show shirts that are fitted, or taper in towards the bottom. This is very much not even close to what they actually are. Not only are they straight all the way down, they are closer to an extra large than a large. Do not buy these based off the picture."
"Jeremy R. Grahn","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered these shirts based on price and overall reviews and was very disappointed. They were smaller than expected, with the sleeves and length being short. I also don't care for the collar. It doesn't hug the neck enough, so it looks loose like it's old, even though it's brand new. The collar is also oddly big.
I will say that I washed them before trying them on. I used warm water and dried them on a low tumble, so they shouldn't have shrank that much."
"Kris","1.0 out of 5 stars","I initially received these and they fit great. The first time I washed them, they shrunk. Cold water, on low heat in the dryer. Definitely buy a size larger than you need."
"Marc","1.0 out of 5 stars","Well, they are shirts. Small to start, shrink in the wash, and paper thin. The price is for disposable shirts, and that's what you get. If you don't need to wear them outside and you live in a warm climate, the price is great."
"falcons forever","1.0 out of 5 stars","The name Gildan used to be the best t-shirt you could buy. Now they are the worst. The necks are too big, they are too short and the upper body has an awkward fit."
"M P","1.0 out of 5 stars","Thin (almost see thru), very scratchy, the size is at least one size too small. Could not wear. Not sold as advertised."
"Clyde51","1.0 out of 5 stars","I'm being censored - free speech is not allowed"
"Debra A.","1.0 out of 5 stars","The first t shirt had a pink stain on it that wouldn‚Äôt come out. And a couple others had tiny holes all in them."
"yrrab","1.0 out of 5 stars","Why is the video so racist?"
"Bruce Jordan","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered v- neck's t- shirts and I received crewneck t-shirts."
"Michigan","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts shrunk 2 sizes after 5 washes. Would not recommend for anyone. They are belly shirts now..."
"bruce whoolery","1.0 out of 5 stars","The quality is horrendous, if only I could return !!!"
"Kevin","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not soft at all feels like you‚Äôre wearing cardboard"
"Jose Omar","1.0 out of 5 stars","I would of gotten five stars if they werent coming apart already smh never again. Im one angry customer"
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Ill fitting and coarse material, even after 2 washings"
"Thanh","1.0 out of 5 stars","Poor quality. I only tried the black shirt. There is a hole on the it."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Be good for shop rags"
"Trust Me","1.0 out of 5 stars","Cheap quality of cloth."
"Gene Wheeler","1.0 out of 5 stars","This black t-shirt is NOT making me feel sexier, sleeker, and more direct. Where are the bad boy vibes? The assassin-like precision? The smart and modern confidence? The international man of intrigue?"
"Tyrannosaurus","1.0 out of 5 stars","I got these because of the good price and generally good reviews. I got the large and out of the package they looked and fit great. However after two washes, they fit like a smaller medium and the length is too short for me now. They look like garbage as around the neck they are fraying already. I will definitely not recommend these to anyone. Better options are Old Navy moisture wicking shirts when they go on sale or Kirkland Tshirts from Costco."
"Bert","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shirts are actually pretty nice but it does say crewneck shirts and the last one in the bag is a stupid v-neck. Must of been a packing mistake. Now that i wore all of them except this one i don't expect ill be able to return them. I would rate it 5 stars if not that one of my shirt is not what i ordered."
"Ryan D","1.0 out of 5 stars","You get what you pay for with this product - I'd recommend to spend your money on a different brand. Although the price is relatively similar to other shirts on the market, these are far inferior in terms of quality and feel. After one wash, they completely lose their shape, never feel soft and even shrunk. More bizarre, its like these shirts are made so LONG in the torso, it bunches up if you tuck in! Likely Gildan found great savings by reducing quality of the cotton they use. Either way, buyer beware - don't buy this crap."
"Stephen","1.0 out of 5 stars","You get what you pay for. Just spend a little more and you will be happy. This shirt chocked me around my neck the first time I try in on! The Hanes X -Temp is very good for the summer and the Fall & Winter the Amazon 100% cotton
is very Soft & Warm. I have tried them all!"
"robie","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought the medium size, I bought 2 different sets, a dozen shirts that shrunk way too much to be worn comfortably. They don't fit anymore after being washed.
Never again will I buy this brand. pay a little more and buy the name brands"
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Le chandail noir rapetisse √©norm√©ment √† la s√©cheuse, m√™me √† d√©licat. Au point d'√™tre inutilisable. Les autres couleurs rapetissent aussi, mais beaucoup moins. On perd 2-3 centim√®tres sur la longueur."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shrank in the dryer. If I lose 10 pound and three inches, it‚Äôll be a perfect fit. But I would never buy this brand again, having read an article in the Globe & Mail about how the exploit their workers in Haiti and Honduras by paying them starvation (literally) wages, and how any move towards unionizing is met with an immediate kick down the road. An immoral company That should be avoided. When a product is cheap, the worker pays the price."
"Allan","1.0 out of 5 stars","The actual product looks nothing like the picture on amazon. XL fits like XXL. When I tried it on it felt like I was wearing a garbage bag. I'm a big guy, 6foot 3inches to be exact. This is why I hate buying stuff online. You never know if what you see in the picture is what you're actually going to get."
"Sahib Singh","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered small size. New T shirt fits well but once washed, it loosed from biceps. Cheap material used by Gildan.
Its only good for home wear and you cant wear for outings once its washed.
I purchased H& M Tees. Better buy H & M Slim fit and regular fit ones. Their stuff is far better and fits perfectly well and wont loosen after wash.
This Gildan t shirt is just good for wastage use once washed. Low quality product."
"GEC","1.0 out of 5 stars","Disappointed with these after first washing. Length shrinks way too much. I bought size 2XL and after I washed them right out of the package in cold water they shrunk so bad I use them once under a shirt and toss them into the garbage.
Do not waste your money"
"Chris Jamieson","1.0 out of 5 stars","2 of my 5 shirts already have popped seams in the armpit area. These shirts are not a tight fit, and I'm not an active person (mild/no wear and tear).. Gildan is certainly not what it used to be in the past. Would not buy again."
"KBS","1.0 out of 5 stars","The photos suggest that these shirts are more narrow at the body and waist than the shoulder. However, the body is in fact wider than the shoulder so if you are looking for something with an athletic fit, look elsewhere."
"A. Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","In the picture it shows the shirts are long enough compared to width. However, I feel like I am a round person when I wear it. I need XL shirts and the ones I get from local shops fits properly. At least doesn't make me look round! It feels like this product is just a piece of rounded cloth with neck & hand holes in it."
"Martin","1.0 out of 5 stars","By the other reviews I can tell the quality of this shirts was as I expected, but I got the delivery for next day after my purchase, and they didn‚Äôt come on time. I had to go on a trip and I couldn‚Äôt have them on time, so I had to run to a store to buy more expensive stuff. I wish I could enjoy them as the other people did, but they didn‚Äôt get to me
On time üëéüèº"
"EC","1.0 out of 5 stars","These looked too good to be true.
Yeah... Too GOOD.
No really though I do not recommend anyone to buy this unless you don't care about the feel of the t-shirt.
These are NOT SOFT at ALL!!!"
"Omar Alejandro Cisneros V","1.0 out of 5 stars","Se devolvi√≥ porque no coincide con la descripci√≥n de camisetas blancas ya que solo son negra y dos tipo de grises"
"Adam DeMeester","1.0 out of 5 stars","So I purchased in June 2020, just opened in September 2020 since I do not wear undershirts until it gets cooler outside. I was sold used, worn, smelly, t-shirts. No joke. Very gross. Of coarse, outside return time. But so gross.
Update: Called Amazon and they are sending replacements at no cost."
"Megan","1.0 out of 5 stars","Just an overall poorly cut shirt. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0 175 and most mediums fit well. These were just weirdly cut for an athletic build. Really short, loose sleeves. Longer than the average tshirt and was very wide through the abdomen. My order got returned very quickly."
"Asif Zulfiqar","1.0 out of 5 stars","It's bad enough the size is wrong, the cheapaterial adds insult to the injury. I didn't even bother to unroll the remaining 4 after putting on one of them."
"Navid","1.0 out of 5 stars","I know it is cheap to but 6 packs of Black t shirt .. but i believe with this quality still not worth it ."
"R.S","1.0 out of 5 stars","Fabric felt itchy and one of the shirts had a small fold that was sewn into the shirt. Would not recommend."

"Deborah W.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered two packages of 12. They were sent out in different shipments. The first one I received two packages of 6.

"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","The white Gildan shirts are literally see through. Verrrrrryyyyy thin material and poor quality. Do not recommend"
"Jimmy Da Silveira","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shirts fit well but quality control sucks. 2 of the 6 shirts came with holes in them in the same location"
"mark","1.0 out of 5 stars","I'm usually an extra large so thought these would fit the x large is more like an xxl and drapes off the body. Realy wish I got the large because now I've wasted money on something I can't wear"
"Curt","1.0 out of 5 stars","This is not a ‚Äúcrew ‚Äú style . I was hoping for something that hugs the body a bit sept this looks like Flipping moo moo around the waistline. Made for someone with a beer gut maybe ? Lol"
"Mark","1.0 out of 5 stars","The length i snot good for a 6 foot guy. You sit down and it rides up. Needs to be longer for an undershirt."
"Adriano da Silva","1.0 out of 5 stars","Very very poor quality, you think it's cheap and when you receive the tees you will realize you were ripped off with this super poor quality.
If you need some rags to clean the shop or just to use once and throw away perfect, otherwise save your money, this is very low quality, and I mean it."
"nate","1.0 out of 5 stars","Bought this pack of shirts and out of the package the shirts fit well and then after a single wash they shrank significantly. I found that both types of grey shirts shrank more than the black ones. It's not really worth buying unless you need ""one use"" shirts."
"Cara","1.0 out of 5 stars","Very dissatisfied with these shirts. Seem nice out of the box, BUT THEY SHRINK!! They shrunk so much after 1 washing, that they were barely wearable. After a second washing, they are pretty much garbage. Never again. Hope a refund is in order from Gildan."
