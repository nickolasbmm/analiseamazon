"Jenn","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are definitely NOT comfort soft as advertised. My husband has been getting Hanes for years and we made the mistake of ordering them here because we found a good deal. Well, you get what you pay for..these must be a knock off or something. They were rough and itch even AFTER a wash. When we got them we realized there was no way they were true Hanes shirts. We submitted a return request but the seller was going to charge a 20% restocking fee and we had to pay for shipping so beware prior to buying. We tried washing a couple times to see if they would get any better but no luck. So we are now using as cleaning rags. So if you’re okay with low quality itchy and rough undershirts, then buy these!"
"Eric","1.0 out of 5 stars","Nothing close to ""ComfortSoft"" at all as stated. Even after several washes and dry, these shirts are still itchy and uncomfortable and if you are wearing it during warm days you will sweat in them and it will become itchy on your skin. I wear this as my undershirt for work while wearing my uniform-issued short sleeve button down shirt and I'm already sweating within minutes. I had 3 older versions of Hanes ComfortSoft Ts just like these ones before and they were very soft and not itchy to wear. The material was perfect and not too thick or too thin. These newer ones here are just ridiculously too thick and itchy."
"paul","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have ordered these on multiple occassions and received a great shirts. Those were tagless and made in dominican republic. It stated clearly that they were 100 % cotton. These are made in Honduras and have tags. In addition no where on the packaging does it state that these are 100 cotton. And they sure dont feel like it. Feels like I'm wearing a bag filled with sweat. Dont breathe at all."
"MPLSMAN","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts are not 100% Cotton as stated in the Hanes banner on web page (feel like mostly polyester); the sizing is completely off as measured and compared to the sizing chart on the web page; the 'black' that I ordered appears to be gray/charcoal; I have purchased many 'ComfortSoft' T-Shirts made by Hanes and these are not like those that I have purchased from other retailers in the past: they are course to the touch, heavyweight, and sized inappropriately. Finally, the shirts arrived in a white plastic bag. When opened, there were four shirts crammed in as if they were grabbed off a shelf and shoved into a bag. No Hanes packaging, etc. Odd. Unlike any Amazon purchase I have received in the past."
"LadyDi","1.0 out of 5 stars","This products advertises Hanes Men's Comfort soft T-Shirt (Pack of 4). When you click on all the different colors not one of the t-shirts have tags on them they all are tag less. We received the navy blue with tags and it doesn't say comfortsoft. See the attached picture. We also ordered deep red, light steel and black are all tag less and say comfortsoft. We ordered twilight blue which is tag less, however, it does not say comfortsoft. See the attached picture. The 3 shirts that were fine came from Amazon services and the 2 wrong shirts did not."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not Comfort Soft T-shirts! These are Hanes generic black t-shirts that should not be described as Comfort Soft. I have purchased Comfort Soft Tees in the past and these are not them! These are made from a rough material and are not soft."
"N. Hogue","1.0 out of 5 stars","Arrived in non branded packaging, just a generic plastic bag. Also the listing says it has a comfort tear away tag, mine came tagless. and they do not say comfort soft. Every time i've purchased comfort soft from a legit store it says it right on the tag/tag print. Or most comfortable. I also can't seem to find this in comfort soft on their webiste so this just seems like a knock off or possibly just re-packing cheaper shirts in cheap bags.
The shirts are VERY stiff, rough to the touch, not stretchy and feel super cheap. Like something you'd get from the internet with a huge screen print on it. Not comfortable, not good seams, the price seemed too good to be true and it was. I feel like i over paid for these flea market rags.
the tag also lists RN15763 as a product number which on a search either brings up womens underwear, or a heavyweight shirt. These do feel heavyweight so possibly legit there but not what is listed on this listing at all. Avoid this merchant at all costs.
Recommend avoiding."
"Kevin","1.0 out of 5 stars","I am a female. I kept finding myself wearing my husband's super soft hanes comfort soft shirts to bed. So I thought I would get my own. These suck. They are not at all ""comfort soft"". My husband's words, ""They feel like a shop rag"". I thought , ""Maybe you can use them as shop shirts."" Nope. He wears a size med. These are med and way too small! They fit me but I am 110lbs and I would actually like them to be bigger. There was someone else who posted a picture of how much smaller they are than the white ones.
Anyway. These are too scratchy, the neck hole is too tight, the length is too short, and they are not soft.
Cons: almost everything
Pro: the color is nice"
"Anon Y Mous","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not Hanes Comfortsoft shirts.
I wear Hanes Comfortsoft shirts on a daily basis and have purchased from many retailers online and in-store. Hanes Comfortsoft shirts are mid-weight, soft, and do not have a tag. The logo, size, and care instructions are printed on the inside of the shirt. These shirts are heavy-weight, course, and have a tag: printed on the inside is the size and ‘made in El Salvador,’ no care instructions.
Furthermore, I always take a size medium. These shirts say medium, but are comically huge, like an XL. Hanes sizing is consistent. Come on."
"Savvy Skeptic","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are *not* Hanes ComfortSoft shirts. The real ones are soft and stretchy with a grey tagless stamp at the neck. These are thick, coarse, scratchy, with minimal stretch and a bogus red tag at the neck that is more scratchy than the shirt itself. The real ones have the ComfortSoft trademark and are tagless. Found those from another seller and they were genuine, shipped in actual Hanes packaging. These arrived shrink wrapped in thick cellophane with no markings. FAKE"
"thedude","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have these shirts that I bought from a local department store and I ended up really liking these shirts, so I wanted to get some more as I try to do minimalism where I wear the same shirt every day. I went back to the original store but they didn't have them anymore so I thought I would try Amazon since Amazon has everything. I ordered these as their description matches the shirts I have exactly, but the shirts I received are completely different.
1. The feel of the fabric sucks on the shirts I received.
2. The shirts I received had tags on them, even though the description says tagless.
3. The fit of the shirts was not the same: chest was looser, arms were looser, etc.
I went ahead and bought the correct shirts from Hanes.com as I didn't want to deal with this anymore. I would advise anyone trying to find good Hanes shirts to go in store or order from Hanes.com"
"kimberly1219","1.0 out of 5 stars","I'm frustrated that I didn't read the reviews prior to my order. Like many others, the shirts I received were not ComfortSoft. The shirts are cheap, thin, and itchy. Hanes - yes. But not ComfortSoft. They are not tagless, no mention of ""ComfortSoft"" on the shirt, just ""Made in Haiti."" Very disappointed and annoyed. Already reached out for a return and refund. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
"A Random Human","1.0 out of 5 stars","I received these shirts about 1 month ago, have washed/worn them no more than 2-3 times. They are already falling apart at the seams. My guess is that they are not actually Hanes at all but fakes. I want my money back but it's already been more than 1 month.
Update - 2.5 months in and 3 of the 4 shirts have fallen apart. I had bought ""the same"" product in 2017 (I used ""buy again"" from my Orders history) and all 4 of those three-year-old shirts are still in tact, just very faded. So something has obviously changed quite drastically and Amazon, while apologetic for my situation, does not seem terribly interested in my experience. $15 completely wasted."
"James Cormack","1.0 out of 5 stars","I don't believe these are genuine Hanes shirts at all. In one of the photos used fo the product, it even states the famous Hanes tagless collar. These are not tagless and ill fitting, and thick. The neck collar is wide. I bought whit and charcoal. The charcoal ones have washing instructions printed inside the back and a stiff scratchy white tag. The White tees have two tags, very stiff and scratchy, one has Hanes on it and the other washing instructions. These are far too heavy for Hanes shirt. Knockoff copies. I have bought many Hanes T-Shirts and none are like this. Hanes trademark is tagless collars. TAGLESS! These are not Hanes shirts."
"mcstan","1.0 out of 5 stars","Washed these shirts in cold water and dried on low heat. Shrunk 8"" in length. Buy extra large if you are 4' tall. I can't believe how a name brand is so shoddy."
"evenstar338","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are the worst I've ever purchased. They are advertised as preshrunk, but they shrank in the wash. They are advertised as comfortable and soft, but they are stiff and rough. The hems flipped up and had to be ironed back down. They are so thick that it's like wearing an ill-fitting sweatshirt. The black ones pick up so much lint that it's truly funny. They were really really wide and not very long. Returning."
"Discipline_This","1.0 out of 5 stars","Ordered some Hanes comfort soft boxer briefs and a pack of these at the same time. They both appear to be knock offs or made with cheaper materials. Upon original opening of the package, the threading is already unraveling along the neck band. These are also not tagless like we thought they were supposed to be and the tag is very rough on the neckline. We are not impressed. But it is not really worth sending back and waiting for more either. Overall not pleased with purchase."
"Brittany and Crystal Wright","1.0 out of 5 stars","5'7 Female...these shirts shrink like nothing I've ever seen. When they first arrived, sizing looked fine. I normally buy fruit of the loom men's small white undershirts. I bought these just because it was the first set I came across. MISTAKE! I even went a size up to medium...but as you can see from the pics the medium Hanes is SMALLER than my old fruit of the loom small! This was after ONE single wash & dry cycle. Can't even tuck it into my pants, as soon as I stretch it comes out. Glad I did a test run on a single shirt first. These are being returned and I'll be buying fruit of the loom."
"Cranky old guy","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have bought and worn Hane' T shirts for fifty years. I have always washed my previous purchases and then worn them. The T shirts were soft and durable. This time I was disappointed.
I have washed this batch of T shirts at least ten times and the material has never softened. The material is stiff and scratchy. The shirts have a label inside the collar that say Hanes but the label is unlike any I have ever seen. The printing is in black with no color.
Hanes has lost a customer."
"Anonymous","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered from these guys 2 months ago and a few days ago with the only difference being from a size M to L and I got entirely different pack that doesn't even come in hanes packaging and it has a tag unlike the previous order. Poor quality cotton, itchy and very firm to the point where your body doesn't look normal in it because of its straightness and unwillingness to conform to the movment of the body. This was also the case for the first purchase from then when i bought the medium pack but it came really tight and going from medium to large feels like going up 2-3 sizes. Terrible buy, definitely going to return it."

"mdmh2o","1.0 out of 5 stars","I wanted some soft short sleeve t-shirts for the winter. I already own a number of Haines' briefs and beefy t's both long and short sleeve which I would highly recommend -- very soft and comfortable and great durability. But I thought I'd try these for a lighter weight. Unfortunately, after first wash they have a sandpaper feel to them on my bare skin. Not the same quality softness as other Haines products I have own. Other than softness it is a good t-shirt but it will be the last one I grab because of roughness and sandpaper feel. Will make good painting shirt but buy a different Haines product because this one will disappoint you."
"Paul A. Angelo","1.0 out of 5 stars","I think the shirts are knock offs. I have bout the same T-shirts from Hanes and the fabric feels different in these t-shirts that i just bough from a third-party seller. These are supposed to be 100% cotton t-shirts but the ones I just received are more lightweight and feel like they have polyester in them. One shirt shrank to 1/2 size after the first washing. The other shrank too but not as much, but they are still snug. There was no return slip in the package either.
Avoid this seller. Next time I'm getting them directly from Hanes."
"SG Winter","1.0 out of 5 stars","No way these are ComfortSoft, they feel like a basic cheap tshirt. I could have gone to the craft store and bought tshirts for two bucks a piece. I bought these instead of the Gildan because I thought they'd be nicer. They do have a tag that simply says ""Hanes"", and then the care info is printed on the shirt itself. Seems like they could have easily been tagless. These were packaged in a plain clear plastic bag, not the retail packaging like I saw in some reviews. If I didn't need undershirts right away, I would be returning these. Bad value for the price"
"J. Bieniecki","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought 2 packs of these to use as workshop shirts. As with all new clothing I wash them once before hanging/folding. One of the shirts came out with the bottom hem nearly completely unraveled. OK fine, they are cheap and I have EZ access to a serger/locksticher so I will fix it. Not so fast, upon second wash 2 more failed the same way.... I have no interest in fixing 8 cheap shirts that I have zero confidence in ANY of the seams now. Returned."
"Endless","1.0 out of 5 stars","I use t-shirts for the gym. I usually just go to a store and get them. I have noticed size difference in the ones from the store too, but it wasn't as bad as all 4 that I got from this seller.
Every single shirt I got fits different. Not just a tad bit bigger/smaller, but very large differences. I am sure all of these are rejects at the factory. 2 of these shirts fit me like a tent or a shirt meant for a woman that is 9 months pregnant. All of them are too short, 2 of them to the point if I lift my arm up, you see my belly button."
"RT","1.0 out of 5 stars","No way are these legit! The comfort soft shirts I've purchased in the past were soft and comfortable. These are the opposite and have a weird fit at the armpits. Plus, real Hanes prints their logo on the fabric. These knockoffs came with a generic Hanes tag attached. Stay away from this counterfeit! Amazon should have better quality control."
"Big d.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not a real Hanes shirt . I can’t believe this ,I wear a lot of t shirt as soon as I open it I knew right away it’s fake. It also doesn’t feel like Hanes t shirt"
"Matt","1.0 out of 5 stars","Bought these thinking they would be comfort soft which compared to the regular t shirts comfort soft are night and day soft. These were tshirts from a tshirt maker with no print yet. Horrible fabric and not what I paid for. Buyer beware!"
"Alex W.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Super weird fit. I bought these for the gym and I got XL so I can reach above head without uncovering my out of shape belly. Well if you're looking for a square fit with arms that are cut way too low and taper weird, then you might like these. The sleeves start so low on the side and taper in a way that makes all this extra material bunch up under my arm. Right in the sweaty part. It's bizarre. Also, they are square after they shrink. Def not long enough for how wide they are. Not to mention that as soon as I start to sweat, they get all saggy and look terrible. I don't write reviews that often, but these were so bad, I felt compelled to."
"Mike S.","1.0 out of 5 stars","There are several shades of orange shirts shown. I ordere 4 4-packs of bright dark orange to go with my outfits. The shirts are EXTREMELY LIGHT and a DULL ORANGE that looks like they were washed over 100s of times and faded out. (I looked to see which color they sent me and discovered that all the various orange color shades were listed as orange) . That's ""false advertising "" . Very upset"
"Grizzly Bear","1.0 out of 5 stars","Purchased Navy Blue 4 pack, did not notice, no pocket! Washed on warm, dried warm and run small. Every other tshirt I own is xtra large for a perfect fit. These after a cool wash and dry are tight like large not xtra large. Most likely make overseas where people are like beanpoles. Very rough feeling materials for 90% cotton. Used fabric softener and dryer sheets and still feel like foreign non cotton material. Returning for refund."
"Jayne","1.0 out of 5 stars","When I saw this was, “comfort soft”, I naively assumed these shirts were comfortable, largely due to softness. Well, joke’s on me, they are neither. Stiff, uncomfortable and built blocky (good for short/stocky, not for thin). Even the, “tagless” label is thick paint that is scratchy and uncomfortable. I have many Hanes products that I really like, but these fell short. Wish Walmart would stock their George t shirts agan."
"brian t.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I don’t write many reviews but I want to save someone from wasting their money on these. I actually do not believe they are legitimate Hanes shirts...
1. They are like cardboard with zero stretch
2. They have a “generic” Hanes logo tag with no info on the tag
3. They came in a bag and not packaging
4. They are trash and are resigned to the garage before I wore all 4 shirts"
"Aliamanu","1.0 out of 5 stars","I washed these beige t-shirts upon receiving them and the color faded noticeably on the sleeves to a yellowish tint. Washed them a second time and the discoloration was noticeable on the main portion of the shirts. I didn’t use any type of bleach, chlorine or non-chlorine, when I washed them. Because of the very obvious and ugly discoloration, they are unsuitable to wear except for when I clean the yard. What a waste of money."
"DD","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not as advertised. Has a tag, does not say comfort fit, and is made in El Salvador. Came in generic plastic-wrapped package of shirts. Other than a ""tag"" saying Hanes I think there are rip off scam. Heavyweight and after one wash the arm cuffs and the bottom of the shirt already rolled up ."
"Monique Scarlett","1.0 out of 5 stars","I literally bought these because I see Hanes as a trusted brand; I'm not even sure I'm convinced these are Hanes. They are NOT Tagless it doesn't come in a branded bag and despite the bag saying (Maroon) which I ordered I got white which I absolutely did not want."
"Brian Zubia","1.0 out of 5 stars","Put it on as soon as it arrived. I work for a few hours and then it started feeling rough against my skin and I had to take it off. I don't know if these are fakes but when you hold the material up to light you could see cross patterns that you can look through like a a cheesecloth. Not so accurate but only thing I can think of that would remind people of the pattern in other words not a very tight weave and definitely not soft I think these are fakes. Do not buy."
"S. Snell","1.0 out of 5 stars","Unfortunately I discovered this after the return window closed. After i washed the shirts i thought they looked small and the fabric wasn't as nice but its the same brand and size i always buy for my hubby so didn't think alot of it. After he started wearing them and they were extremely uncomfortable (not as breathable and they shrunk to almost a midriff status) He asked me what brand they were. I told him Hanes but then looked at the shirts and they have no label! not even the usual printed one. The worst. Don't purchase."
"David F","1.0 out of 5 stars","When I read a product's description that's what I expect to receive from Amazon. I purchased the Black, Navy, Green, Ash, and Orange. The Black were the only ones that matched the item's description. The rest had tags and were not 100% cotton. I tried each of them on to compare and there's a noticeable difference in the quality between the Black and the other colors. Now I'll have to go through the hassle of returning these."
"Charles Wheeler","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts will work but they are scratchy even after 5 or 6 washings. I know for sure what Haines T's are supposed to be like and these aren't them. You can tell right away by the very lightly printed inside brand stamp that something is wrong. Perhaps you will get the proper product when you order, but check when they arrive and return if not right."
"Cody","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are either not comfort soft products or the comfort soft brand is now junk. These do not have the packaging or the tags that you receive in a store and are not the same quality. Not even close. They are rough and not comfortable at all. Only explanation is that they are knock off products and not actually being sold by Hanes"
"charlie","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not authentic Hane's ComfortSoft t-shirts. They arrived in a clear plastic bag with no branding. The tag on the shirt has no mention of ComfortSoft. I have purchased ComfortSoft before and the tag says ComfortSoft. Also, these shirts are rough, thick and not the correct size. Returning."
"Daniel Kellogg","1.0 out of 5 stars","I only received 2 shirts. I thought I was to get 4 shirts. The pic shows 4 shirts and the description says 4 shirts. There is no way to correct this problem unless they send me 2 more shirts. So I am very Disappointed. Amazon needs to call me and refund half the money. I got half the order. Thanks every body for letting me vent. Take care and be safe..."
"Christopher","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered these by accident while looking for Hane's (5250) tagless comfort soft t-shirts. I live overseas where they do not have shirts that fit me very well or that I like. I got used to Hane's brand back home and I order them every year. After waiting to get these I washed them and put one on and within an hour I had to take it off as I was itching horribly and had red spots all over my upper body. I thought it was a fluke and tried again with the same result. I tried washing them in baby detergent that is perfume and dye-free but the same result. Something in the fabric of these shirts causes me to have an allergic reaction and I do not have any allergies as I was tested extensively in the military for them. These shirts are not even wearable and were a complete waste of time and money."
"John E. Auer","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are cheap poly blend shirts with a fake Hanes tag. I have many real Hanes comfortsoft shirts and these aren’t even close. They are shirt...everything else in the description is a lie. The counterfeit quality is laughable. Plus Hanes went tagless years ago. These shirts have a single tag with a poor Hanes logo, no size, no washing instructions, no nation of origin. How does Amazon allow such counterfeiting on Prime items? This is literally criminal. Clean up your mess Amazon. Your wasting my time. Makes me hesitant to buy cloths through Amazon."
"121","1.0 out of 5 stars","I am not sure why Amazon allows counterfeit items to be sold. These are completely fake. For one thing, they smell horrible. One of the shirts is already unraveling. Thankfully I am able to send them back. I've noticed lately that I have been getting a lot of fake items on Amazon and I am now starting to shop with their competitors as a result"
"Dean Michael","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have purchased Hanes ComfortSoft t-shirts before and they were very soft and felt great! These that I most recently purchased had tags and were very, very itchy. I could not even wear them, sadly I had already cut off the tags and washed them otherwise I probably would have returned them. Very disappointing!"
"pastorlindas","1.0 out of 5 stars","Product number on packaging appears to be correct, but tags indicate 50-50 cotton/polyester. Not as advertised❗️DISAPPOINTED ☹️ ❗️
Returning"
"Kristie Nelson","1.0 out of 5 stars","Just received this pack of 4 shirts. Outside package was fine but once I opened that the inner clear plastic sleeve around the shirts I saw moisture in the bag. Taking the shirts out they were all extremely wet! No idea why very gross. Immediately put them in the washer. Hoping for the best when they are done."
"Christopher","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are supposedly 90% cotton. However, these are very rough even after wash and dry.
The 2nd problem is that the waistband tries to stay flipped up. And when I say tries to stay flipped I mean like trying to fight Mike Tyson over the last piece of bacon, it’s a loosing battle.
I hated them so much that I tried to use them for a dog bed and the dogs rejected them as if they were made from the dead soul of Clifford."
"Kindle Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these Men's T Shirts to wear around the house. I usually wear a medium, but since these were just for casual, I went with a large. I could barely get my head through the neck hole and the arms were far too tight (I'm not jacked). It felt like an extra small or boy's size. I went to Wal-Mart and bought Faded Glory brand which are truer to size and are softer. Would not recommend these shirts even at the price.."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not real this time. Bought same item back in May and got actual Hanes comfort soft shirts. Hit the buy again button and what I received this time is a knock off or much lower quality shirt. These shirts this time have tags last time didn’t. Tag just says Hanes no other markings, last time it was screen printed Hanes comfort soft. Even the picture has been recently updated to show the cheaper quality shirt with tags, before it did not show a tag in the picture.
These shirts are also cut different than the real comfort soft shirts I received last time. They almost feel like they are on backwards if that makes any sense, not so uncomfortable that I can’t wear them but I do notice it."
"True religon","1.0 out of 5 stars","Great....... sum kind of tshirt it's a hanes mimmick of the white T tees we all were .but it's a dud .the pick is confusing. and it's a RIP off happy shopping. at that price! 20 to one pack !it's not even a under shirt !cause it have that white tee fill and it's a tshirt! not a white tee it's a scratchy fake hanes shirt hanes is a bit smooth to the skin this is a hangs t shirt happy shopping"
"Kayla B.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Purchased these for my fiance for work.... They definitely were NOT Hanes, were NOT cotton. Shirt says made in the Dominican Republic and 100% cotton. Have purchased the same type in store and the fabric is way different and softer. Also, it stated ""tagless"" and came with tags. Had to rip them off... So many red flags that these WERE NOT HANES BRAND SHIRTS! Will not be purchasing again"
"John C","1.0 out of 5 stars","This is more about the listing than the shirts. I bought three different colors and each was different. One was thick, 100% cotton, second was thin, 90% cotton, while the third was 50% cotton/ 50% polyester. Even though the banner in the middle of the page says ""100% Cotton"". And from reading reviews, even with the same color, the shirts you receive may be different depending on where they are sourced. This is ridiculous and Amazon should put a stop to it."
"Joe","1.0 out of 5 stars","When I first wore these they were actually a bit baggy which I'm fine with. After washing (on cold water) then drying (on low heat for about 30 minutes) they shrunk to the point where they barely fit over my head.
If you do buy these, make sure that you buy one or even two sizes larger.
Unbelievable."
"Harry Arianas","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not Hanes products, but some imitation, using a cheap, sewn-in tag. The shirts are itchy, and do not fit to size. I would return them, but washed them (COLD water, to minimize shrink), so will now donate them.
I do not recommend buying from this seller."
"dakotahorse","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not real Haynes. I have got Haynes comfort soft before, Navy blue from walmart/target ect. I ordered these while on deployment, what a waste of time and sucks when I needed them, and I get something that is unusable. Not only was the color way off, each LG shirt fit differently, I should of known from the start when I opened the box and they were in a normal plastic bag, not a labeled Haynes one. Anyone can screen print now adays, save the time, and just go to the store."
"Jake Fantom","1.0 out of 5 stars","After a single wash, my large t-shirts shrank to the size of a small. Probably the most extreme shrinkage I have ever experienced. By comparison, a similar pack of Fruit of the Loom t-shirts I bought a few years back didn't shrink at all. So I am guessing Hanes uses some kind of truly inferior cotton in this product. In any case, I can't wear them after one wash. Another Goodwill donation I guess."
"beachbound","1.0 out of 5 stars","So rough. No way, no how this is considered soft. I really just wanted T shirts to sleep in but these fail miserably. They shrunk in a funny way. Now they are shortand wide (size L). I just wanted to replace the really soft Hanes t shirt that was about 12 years old until my wife tore it."
"Brooke","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not soft at all, also definitely not a small. I’ve seen some other reviewers say it shrinks, so it may very well shrink down to a small but out of the package it is much larger than an average small. Either way, I didn’t want to take the chance to see by washing because the material is uncomfortable. Doesn’t feel like genuine Hanes. Sent back."
"Alex E","1.0 out of 5 stars","I've been ordering ComfortSoft from Hane's for a few years. The fit and tagless nature of the shirts always made them great undershirts for typical day-to-day. My recent order came today to cycle out some of my older, worn shirts. Unfortunately, this review will echo the other bad reviews. The shirts that arrives had the ""tear away"" tag on poor quality fabric. It's a shame. The hunt for a new undershirt begins."
"stevens","1.0 out of 5 stars","I used to like Hanes brand in the past, but their quality is just under decline in the past few years. This T-Shirt is simply dreadful, and I should thought twice when I saw the price tag. For those who are looking for a comfort T-Shirt that does not ""scratch"" your skin, you should avoid Hanes in any possible way. The T-Shirt does not feel like 100% cotton at all... more like polyester. I compared that with all my other 100% cotton T-shirt, this one is just not feeling right at all."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Black XXL
Use to love Hanes ComfortSoft shirts but they are not at all what they used to be. The shirt is not soft at all and shrank more then normal after being washed. There was a tag but it was easily removed and marked only with Hanes logo. The print on the inside of the shirt only has the size and where it was made (El Salvador). I've noticed that a lot of the larger companies like Hanes have vastly dropped the quality of their products. Id skip out on your old favorites and look to smaller companies with much higher quality products.
Cons:
- has tag
- overpriced for what you get
- picture is not the same as what you get
- shrinks way more then it should
- scratchy after being washed
Pros
- the tag from this tagless shirt is easy to remove"
"Andrew T.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Opened after the return date had expired, or I would've returned them. The weirdest fitting Hanes T-shirts I've ever owned. I think they sewed two back panels together, and just shipped them anyhow. Nice new clean rags(for $16.50) Just go to Khols, or Target."
"kayak_01","1.0 out of 5 stars","One wash, and the shirts were unwearable. They shrank a full size. Also, the arms are attached too low. When you lift your arm, it pulls up the shirt. Thirdly, the material is extremely rough. The shirts are certeinly inexpensive, but in this case, you get less than you paid for."
"indranee","1.0 out of 5 stars","Definitely not soft and definitely not comfortable! I bought this for my dad who’s in his 90s and has shrunk considerably in size, so I bought mediums, but still too tight. Would not recommend. If you do need to buy them, by two sizes larger, however there’s nothing much to be done for the rough feel of the fabric. Definite buyer beware here."
"Sharonsden","1.0 out of 5 stars","My husband won’t wear these. Big waste of my money!! I was sure they were soft cotton that I had bought before, these were very stiff not at all soft, even when I tried to soften them, no luck! Trash"
"Bo","1.0 out of 5 stars","Low quality material. Neck is very oversized and will stretch at the slightest pull. I ordered a small (usually a medium shirt guy) because this would be an under shirt and it it so loose in the neck I might as well not even wear it. Very low quality."
"Ladybug","1.0 out of 5 stars","I used to buy packs of these shirts. I am female. I like mens tshirts, and it was an easy way to get a bunch of the same black tshirts. These are pretty bad. The material isn't soft, the cut of the sleeves are awful. These will be desperation around the house shirts."
"Squeaky Squid","1.0 out of 5 stars","I feel like these shirts were made in complete darkness by a four-year-old. These shirts came in the same pack yet none of them fit the same. The collars on some of the shirts are all stretched out and the sleeves come to a point making you look like a triangle. Out of all the shirts in the pack only one of them fit sort of okay and even then it still looked ridiculous"
"Donnie Mcdonald","1.0 out of 5 stars","I am an everyday black shirt person I own probably about 20 black T-shirts and always buy Hanes I usually get a new pack every 2 months! I found this pack on here and for the price I couldn’t deny it! I really don’t think these are Hanes T shirts the rags were a little weird placed and the fabric felt different then my normal Hanes t shirts I wore 2 of them and washed them on delicate as I always do and they SHRUNK sooooo bad ! Definitely want a refund!"
"rosiedee","1.0 out of 5 stars","Comfortsoft?? For a shirt using softness as a selling point, they definitely make the brand look bad. There's nothing particularly soft about them unless a coarse burlap bag is soft. This was one of the main features I was looking for. Even after washing they didn't really soften up, and I can't very well return them once washed. Extremely disappointed."
"M. Bischoff","1.0 out of 5 stars","Great fit out of the package. Washed once and shrunk so much in length that the bottom of the shirt is at my belt, and if I bend over, it's all lower back sticking out. Not good."
"Actual Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shirt rides up on the front of the neck. The tag absolutely drives me crazy. Yes I said tag. Even though the description says tagless it has a tag. This is not the shirt I ordered, it's nothing like my previous shirts that I really like. The picture shown is the same shirt I have bought previously and really like, but zoom in and you'll see no tag is shown these shirts have tags.
If I hadn't cut out the tag and washed the shirt I would return them. I have only worn one shirt, guess I'll give the others to someone.
This is for the white shirt."
"Heather","1.0 out of 5 stars","This product is not at all as described. We own a lot of Hanes comfortsoft clothes and these T-shirts are definitely not comfortsoft. The material is very scratchy, stiff and the shirts have tags."
"D. Emmel","1.0 out of 5 stars","I should have read the other reviews. These are possibly counterfeit and have no similarity to any other official Hanes t-shirt I've purchased from Amazon or any other retail store. The material is thicker than the standard ComfortSoft shirt and it has tags instead of the tagless design."
"Barry Chapman","1.0 out of 5 stars","After 3-4 months the shirts start to turn pink. I bought 2 packs over a 5 month period. Even tried changing detergents. Guess ill try another brand. But if you want shirts that slowly turn pink look no further."
"Kyle D.","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts arrived but it was obvious once opening them that they were not as advertised. The material was not the patented ComfortSoft Hanes material. They were rough, felt like 4 generic Black Ts bought from a design your own T-Shirt company. Returned immediately. You're better off buying directly from Hanes or an outlet."
"JOutterbridge","1.0 out of 5 stars","8-2017
If you are a small or medium expect a loose fit with short sleeves and a wide torso. If you're tall look elsewhere unless you are a XXL waist. Idk how the large is but these are unnaturally wide for most slim or athletic guys. They shrink a ton too and not in the right areas. I cant sit without feeling my back exposed. Uneven length. These are lower quality than the ones I got in a retail store. Not as comfortable AT ALL."
"Michael Jaramillo","1.0 out of 5 stars","I wrote a previous review that got taken down. The reason.. with the shirt's poor quality I figured the t-shirts had to be fake. No way could they had been Hanes. I had purchased Hanes Comfortsoft tees for several years and knew how they used to feel, medium weight and soft. These shirts were coarse like freebie shirt-cannon type shirts. The folks at Amazon verified they were authentic, so my bad. Apparently, however that means Hanes ComfortSoft quality has plummeted and are not even worth sale prices. Our loss."
"TIA","1.0 out of 5 stars","I had to use these as shop rags. I tried each one and the sewing / pattern was incorrect. Had a weird feeling to it. Most uncomfortable plus it is cheaply made. Wash it once and it started to unravel."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have worn Hanes comfort soft medium for years. These are nothing like the ones I have worn. The name, size, material, etc is not inked into the shirt as it has been for years rather just the name “Hanes” is printed on a thin paper like tag sewn on the collar with no size or material description, nor does it say country of origin as the law requires. Plus it shrinks after one washing."
"Liss Kron","1.0 out of 5 stars","Now I know why they are so cheap, cardboard is softer than these tshirts."
"Ashley Cook","1.0 out of 5 stars","Hanes has gone down from what I remember. These shirts are not comfortable or soft, they are scratchy and rough. The seams starting coming out of the sleeves on two shirts after one or two washes. Spend a couple bucks more per shirt and get American Apparel."
"Megan","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have a hard time believing what I received was 100% cotton Hanes shirts. The fabric is stiff and not breathable, the stitching on EVERY SHIRT is twisted, messy and extremely rough. I bought this for a comfortable undershirt for my chef coats. I’m so disappointed. No Hanes logo printed on the shirt, I’m wondering what the hell was actually sent to me."
"D. F. Carver","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not as advertised. How can this possibly have as many stars for this product as claimed!? I do not believe this listing is the actual brand or product advertised. There is a tag (which would not be found on a “comfort soft” hands t-shirt. The material is not “soft” and it was not in Hanes packaging when it arrived. Unfortunately this is not the first time this has happened on Amazon. Shame on me for ordering from amazon again..."
"Hypercussion","1.0 out of 5 stars","No disrespect to the seller, this item arrived quickly but the quality is TERRIBLE! I have Hanes T-shirts that are years old and just now getting very faded and worn. But these new shirts from Hanes are thin as cheaply made as can be but that's not even the worst part. I washed them once in cold water and delicate low heat dryer and they shrunk so much, I can't wear them. Maybe my neighbors kid can, he's a toddler and that's the size shirts I have now."
"Craig Bergland","1.0 out of 5 stars","I really doubt that these are Hanes shirts. Most of the usual size information is printed on the shirt fabric as you would expect. Then a Hanes label is sewn on at the neck with one line of thread. They certainly are closer to burlap than to Hanes soft fabric. Skip these."
"mx229","1.0 out of 5 stars","These all had tags + the size printed on the inside of the shirt below the tag, and they shrunk to about a medium in the wash. Not impressed. The last batch of these shirts I purchased were tag-less like they are supposed to be, and did not shrink very much in the wash. As another purchaser noted, I'd suspect these as being counterfeit. I'd return them, but I washed them all assuming they were what they were supposed to be."
"Maniko Beach","1.0 out of 5 stars","I am looking to specifically replace ComfortSoft shirts, but I received four plain black-thick Hanes t-shirts. This shirt pack did not say ComfortSoft on label, but came with a standard Hanes tag. Material is harder and scratchier."
"James Lord","1.0 out of 5 stars","I got a set of these from the local store years ago that felt amazing, and attempted to get the same thing online.
This version of the shirt feels itchy. I thought it just needed to go through the laundry once, but that didn't really improve the feel."
"Timothy D. Thompson","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are NOT Hanes. These shirts are NOT tagless and Hanes hasn’t made a tagged shirt in a long time. Actually these have double the tags: one on the neck and one by the waist. They also were not in a Hanes package. They came piled together with some tape around them. Amazon should remove these imposters from their site!"
"K. E. Kenerson","1.0 out of 5 stars","I’ve purchased the Hanes undershirts for work for many years, for whatever reason the material on these shirts was very thick, and they shrunk considerably in the dryer. Very disappointing, I’ve come to expect quality and consistency from this brand, not sure what’s up with this batch of shirts."
"Kasey","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not real Hanes Comfort Soft Shirts. The material is scratchy and the logo is just screen printed on. When the package arrives it is just 4 white shirts in a clear plastic bag. No sign of a Hanes logo or packaging anywhere. Also the title of the item says ""Hanes Men's ComfortSoft T-Shirt (Pack of 4). These are Hanes HEAVYWEIGHT shirts. Much thicker and fit different than the original ComfortSoft shirts."
"Alexander","1.0 out of 5 stars","It’s an obvious knock off, it came with no official Hanes packaging, the shirt has a cheap tag, and the shirt itself has no “ComfortSoft” logo anywhere!"
"Mike","1.0 out of 5 stars","They have an unpleasant off honey kind of chemical smell. The first batch i order had the smell slightly and after washing it I no longer smelled it. So I purchased another batch, washed it and but it still had the horrible odor. Washed it again and wore it and had to take it off since the smell was overpowering.
I noticed the fit was not quite the same as the last batch. It is a shame Hanes quality is hit or miss these days. They are destroying their brand."
"Caitlin Fildes","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are awful... scratchy no matter how many times you wash them and they shrink super bad. I am not even entirely convinced these are actually Hanes and not some counterfeit knock off, no tag just some printing. I’d report it but they wouldn’t do anything about it anyway...."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Thin material, and rips easily. Absolute garbage. Two day shipping actually means 7 day shipping."
"Ely","1.0 out of 5 stars","Very rough, not cotton. The details of the product on the website doesn't match the real product, I ordered a pack of 4 black ones, they come with a plastic Hanes tag, no any description about the fabric, doesn't feel like cotton. I was planning to return but the location to return the product is far so am I make a donation to a charity."
"jam","1.0 out of 5 stars","These were possibly made near a nuclear plant? After being soaked in vinegar, washed for months, etc... they smell of a metallic blood, beast from the crypt… I know that sounds funny… But I don't know how to explain it. There is nothing I have ever smelt like that in my life. It's very difficult to sit next to someone wearing these without a gag reflex."
"AZmon Family","1.0 out of 5 stars","this was fine at first until i came back from laundry. they shrink so bad as much as one size lower.
i normally wear L but i had to order XL for this. i want loose fit as i chose this to wear at home.
but they shrunk so bad. maybe the material problem. try to wear and wash one first before you make a decision."
"Madisen Bogard","1.0 out of 5 stars","These were definitely NOT a genuine Hanes product. There was a tear off Hanes tag in the shirts, on a tagless shirt, came in a clear bag, and say made in Honduras (not the Dominican Republic that true Hanes products say! I'm a wiz at washing clothes and these shrunk, after several washes they still feel stiff, and I'm so disappointed that my first review on a product I bought is a 1 star review! I went to Walmart and bought what I was supposed to get from this supplier and the only similarity is they're both white. Tsktsk Shame on you"
"K. Trapp","1.0 out of 5 stars","Unwearable. Bought the charcoal grey in XL to sleep in. Other reviewers mentioned shrinkage - which is in the 5-10% range after cold water wash and low heat dryer. The real issue is that these are NOT soft, even with fabric softener. This is probably due to the fact that they are a 50/50 cotton-poly blend. Be very careful with the color you choose if you want 100% cotton."
"D S","1.0 out of 5 stars","Most likely fake. Material is neither soft nor comfortable. Probably wash the color out before it even gets soft. Not tag less either. Do yourself a favor and don't buy these."
"G Jones","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts arrived waded together and squished into a polymailer bag unsealed. The outsider shirt was dirty in multiple spots.
Not sure if these are true Hanes products."
"BrettE","1.0 out of 5 stars","Don’t make the mistake and order these expecting comfortable shirts. I couldn’t even wear mine once before it returned them.
Hanes makes some very comfortable tees, but these are NOT them."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these in 2018 from the same Amazon listing and they were great. I wore them for a full year. I just ordered these again(literally just went to my old order and repeated it) and the product feels completely different. The material is definitely different. I have no idea what it is, but its itchy and coarse. A 100% turn around from what I bought a year ago and became my favorite shirts. Not really worth the trouble of sending these back from overseas. Very disappointed. I feel like I bought a cheap knockoff of a plain black shirt....."
"Just Roy","1.0 out of 5 stars","These have to be knock offs of real comfortsoft shirts....the ones I bought at the store are super soft...hence the name ""comfortsoft"".. The ones I bought on here are like burlap compared to mine...the material is rough and scratchy..the screen print in the neckline looks different than my store bought shirts..all in all..if you love to sleep in your shirts or just like the softness to wear all day..this is not the shirt for you...I would prefer my money back.."
"sop1lady","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are NOT Comfortsoft it Comfort fit as described. They are the typical hard/crunchy/stiff/extremely uncomfortable-to-wear Hanes t-shirts. Also, they are NOT tagless. Just awful."
"Dustin","1.0 out of 5 stars","I was looking for the ""perfect fit T"" that Hanes used to make, their Medium fit me, well, perfectly. I am 6' 1"" (185cm) and around 175lb. Generally Medium shirts fit me well, however thse shirts are at least a full size larger than i would expect a medium fit. Also the cut of these shirts is fairly boxy and the fabric has no stretch to it so if you're looking for something that fits like a trash bag, this might be for you, otherwise look elsewhere."
"Eric Nordseth","1.0 out of 5 stars","Very uncomfortable, I have tagless Hanes comfort soft that I love . These are not . They have tags and feel like wool not cotton. I thought they would soften up after awhile And washing them. They don’t."
"Mooosic","1.0 out of 5 stars","Coarse material, rather thick, not comfortable like Hanes Comfort soft. Feels more like a name brand paper towel than a shirt. Too uncomfortable for Southern California summer. Will try wearing again during cold season. Picture not necessary just use your imagination.
XL in this brand is like XXL in Hanes Comfort fit. size down if you enjoy wearing paper towels."
"Ronald Mulhern","1.0 out of 5 stars","Ordered same size that I had ordered previously of the Hanes Brand. In fact I ordered 4 t-shirts! To much “bother” to return so I wear them as “paint shirts”! Tolally NOT appropriate to wear in public as they are WAY too “sloppy” ..."
"Ryan Grande","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not only are these not even remotely comfortable, they’re itchy. I bought them in black and white after reading an article claiming they were top ten most comfortable tees for men (CLEARLY paid advertising there). I highly recommend avoiding these, you’ll be disappointed.
I tried them on, felt awful, tried washing them and using fabric softener. Still awful. I donated them."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Advertised as ""ComfortSoft"" model which has a specific softness and is tagless, but received a non-ComfortSoft model. I requested the advertised version and the second set received was the not ComfortSoft version again."
"Gerry","1.0 out of 5 stars","They are NOT soft. I have old Hanes T-Shirts and those are still soft. But this is either a fake or Hanes doesn’t have any quality control. It says clearly that the shirts are soft but they are scratchy."
"Sue C.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered the “Comfort Soft “ tshirt because I have several and love their fit and feel.
As soon as these arrived I knew there were just the low end plain old Haines Tshirt. After washing the shrink to aM edium size so now my husband has new work shirts to mechanic in."
"Sara Shell","1.0 out of 5 stars","The ones I received are fake, they are not actual Hanes. They are too thick, and just have a fake tag seen in that says ""Hanes"" with basic product information printed on the shirt but no brand name."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered these shirts to replace ones I've bought in the past. The ones I bought in the past were way more comfortable than these ones. The ones I was sent are 100% cotton, even though the ones I ordered were supposed to be some percentage polyester mix. My old ones are 25% polyester 75% cotton. Maybe it's possible I got sent some kind of knock off. These are not only less comfortable, they are sized slightly small. I'm returning the ones I bought."
"LA Hillbilly","1.0 out of 5 stars","says 100% cotton... but these T-shirts are not soft nor as comfortable as any of my other Hanes t-shirts. They are rough /scratchy. The packaging and label seem to suggest a ""low end"" Hanes discount/bulk bin product. I am disappointed."
"P & K Walsh","1.0 out of 5 stars","I was really excited to use these as bed shirts - they are call comfort and soft. The pack I received were neither conformable or soft. Very rough and coarse fabric. I don't get why everyone is rating this product so high, other than it's a cheap 4 pack of shirts. I'm wondering if I received a bad batch? I returned them."
"Zak","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are NOT Hanes Comfortsoft T-Shirts! These are the cheap, thick, scratchy T-Shirts that people throw away. They say ""Hanes"" on them but I wouldn't be surprised if they were knock-offs. I have had ComfortSoft shirts before, and they are much thinner and very soft. Buyer beware!"
"Mike G","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not Comfortsoft shirts, i would be willing to bet they are not even hanes. These are similar to the gildan heavy weight cotton shirts i used to wear for work, they are not that comfortable, shrink a lot, and are actually more expensive/less quality than the last gildan shirts I bought. I got mine with most of the threads falling out of the bottom seams. These are absolute garbage, dont waste your money!!!"
"K. MacDonald","1.0 out of 5 stars","This isn't what I expected at all. With the number of positive reviews I expected a decent product. These are not soft at all. Smaller than expected and just plain not comfortable at all. The material is almost stiff, scratchy and very uncomfortable. They will make great rags."
"Micah J Jakes","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not Comfortsoft shirts. These have a tag on the collar. Real Comfortsoft are tagless. Came in unmarked clear plastic. Not a retail package. These look like bulk shirts that a screen print shop would use."

"Shirley's keeper","1.0 out of 5 stars","First , these aren’t Hanes comfort line , These are no more than regulate tee shirts black in color , Confort is 50% polyester and 50% cotton , the once sent me are 100% cotton , and they want me to take a 1.50 restocking fee to return them ,"
"zak","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are so itchy they feel as though they are made from fiberglass. Horrible product. I thought they would soften up after washing a few times but I was wrong."

"jacjac23","1.0 out of 5 stars","Was supposed to receive a pack of 4. Only received 1 shirt. The third party did refund me for the three shirts but it’s a bit disappointing as I can’t reallt give a pack of one Hanes shirts as a stocking stuffer."
"Stephen R","1.0 out of 5 stars","I don't understand how Hanes can have such a difference in quality in their t-shirts from pack to pack. I bought the same exact pack of t-shirts a little over a month ago and they were great, every pack of t-shirts I've bought since have been either too big, too boxy, or just itchy and uncomfortable this is the last time I give any more of my money to this company and i guess I'll have to look elsewhere from now on."
"Biagio C.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Either Hanes has really lowered their quality or these are knock offs. Didn't fit, scratchy material. Shrunk 2 sizes in first wash and dry. Gave them to a friend to workout in. Don't waste your $$"
"W. G. Cooney","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts appear to be inauthentic. The tags, the feel, everything feels and looks wrong. I have no proof, but if these were real, I would be moving on from Hanes whose shirts have always been great for me. Do not buy from this listing!"
"woody","1.0 out of 5 stars","These aren't up to date Hanes shirts. They still have the scratchy tag. Not soft for daily wearing and not thick enough to be a blue collar work T Shirt. I hated them so much I bought Amazon's brand and those are much better."
"JW","1.0 out of 5 stars","Did not send comfort soft shirts. Sent regular Hanes shirts. There is a difference."
"Clark","1.0 out of 5 stars","Very scratchy despite washing it several times before Wearing it. It has not gotten better with wear. Collar stitching is not flat, so it rubs."
"andrew","1.0 out of 5 stars","The fabric is very cheap and uncomfortable. Not enough fabric softner to fix this burlap-like material. Also, the color is more red than orange.
I would say ""you get what you pay for"" except that walmart has nice, comfortable orange work shirts for just over 4 bucks ea."
"readsalot","1.0 out of 5 stars","I've purchased Hanes Comfort Soft t-shirts before and these ain't them. These are stiff and scratchy. They also don't have ""comfort soft"" on the label like the other ones I've purchased. Counterfeit?"

Update - already getting hole in arm seam. Do not recommend"
"Nick","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not the Hanes tagless Comfort Tee's I expected.
These are the Heavy Duty Comfort Ts in a 4 Pack. I whish the Black 4 Pack description said that. They are much thicker than a normal Hanes Under shirt.
The neck collar on one of the shirts is almost more like a V neck than a regular Crew.
I think they are Hanes quality control rejects or fakes. Next time I'll just buy direct from Hanes."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","These have tags, they are not the comfort soft shirts and they smell weird- like vinegar! Uncomfortable, stiff material! Very disappointed!"
"Kristen price","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not as advertised. These are knock offs do not buy them. They are not the real deal and the material is really cheap. Even after washing they feel like nylon or some weird cheap material. These shirts suck."
"Les","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are awful shirts. They are very small and when washed on cold and hung to dry, they shrunk to the point I couldn’t put it over my head. It also has tags and are ridiculously thick. Don’t buy these. I didn’t send them back because our Post Office is crowded. Also, they weren’t even what I ordered. I’m just not that picky so I thought I’d just wear them. That’s not possible. These are THE WORST SHIRTS."
"Wireless wizard","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not soft at all and they shrink quick! If looking to buy for an undershirt, look elsewhere. If looking to buy as a regular shirt, look elsewhere. Way too itchy and rough, even after washing."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","These T shirts arrived in a clear plastic bag. The tags were not Hanes official logo. And Hanes T-shirts do not have a tag on the inside bottom of there t-Shirts. Do not waste your time buying. Don’t why Amazon doesn’t believe there are a lot of cheater and scammers in this world."
"Hermeneusis","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are significantly heavier than the Comfortsoft line.
These do not have the Comfortsoft label printed, instead there is a tag. The tag is very easy to remove just by pulling, but it's simply not the product that is listed."
"frank camarena","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these black shirts a while back and the tag said Hanes, I reordered some more a couple of weeks ago, and it has a fake Hanes tag on it and they were thin. I should have sent them back but I kept them today one of the shirts ripped at the left shoulder. New shirt. Never again...."
"P.F","1.0 out of 5 stars","NOT ComfortSoft at all! You can see in te pictures that they don’t say ComfortSoft. Just standard fabric, very itchy and uncomfortable. I didn’t pay attention to those reviews stating those facts and well, it turns out they were right! Really disappointed."
"Gregory Maciejewski","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered 1 size larger than I wear which fit ok out of the package. I wear a large, ordered XL. I washed them in cold water on delicate , dried on gentle low heat. They shrunk so small I can barely get them on. They are junk. The only winner here is the Salvation Army who will get these when the bag is full and donation time comes."
"Stephanie","1.0 out of 5 stars","As other reviewers have noted, these are NOT COMFORTSOFT. Amazon, please remove these sellers from your site for false advertising. ComfortSoft fits much better than these ridiculous things."
"Anangke","1.0 out of 5 stars","These run two sizes small. The size I got should have been like a dress on me but it barely fit. I understand why these were on sale."
"G-Man","1.0 out of 5 stars","I had purchased ComfortSoft T-Shirts at a traditional store and were very please with fit and soft material. Even though these shirts are listed as ComfortSoft, they did not feel like the same material. These shirts were a bit small initially, material a little too heavy , definitely not soft, and shrunk up after the first few washes. I was sorry I purchased 3 packages of 4 shirts each. I had to throw them all away. Not sure what happened here."
"Nicholas A.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought the 4 pack in white. These are not the ComfortSoft shirts that are advertised. They have a tag and do not say ComfortSoft anywhere on them. They came in a plain, clear plastic bag. For all I know this may be the exact same material and cut as the ComfortSoft, but I doubt this product was actually produced by Hanes. Seems to be just another ripoff, which are becoming all too common on Amazon."
"codeman","1.0 out of 5 stars","I am very disappointed that Amazon would try to pass a cheap knock off as the real thing. If you own Hanes comfort soft tees like the ones pictures you know they are tagless. I do own them but what they sent was some cheap short with the Hanes label sewn in The material was thin and cheap. It was not the thick comfortable material you get when you purchase true Hanes comfort soft tees. I've added pictures to show you what I received versus what I own. I specifically searched for and ordered the shirt they have pictured. I received the cheap stuff."
"Tabitha","1.0 out of 5 stars","Perfect if you like the feeling of burlap scratching the crap out of your skin. Even after several washings, these shirts are unbearably scratchy. I tried wearing one but didn't last five minutes. Also, the arm holes are weird and cause the back to pull tight when moving. Normally I donate unwanted clothing, but these are so bad that they're going to the trash."
"Victoria","1.0 out of 5 stars","They fit in the gigantic tent way I wanted them to, however, they're definitely not worth five dollar a shirt. They're cheap, rough fabric with no breath-ability. Terrible. I was cheated. Would never buy again. Probably fake Hanes, I don't remember them being this scratchy and cheap."
"Shane Smith","1.0 out of 5 stars","I guess these are hit or miss. I bought a set of these a few years ago and loved them. Very disappointed with this purchase. Items arrived in a plastic bag with no hanes branding. Items shrunk considerably in wash. The shirts are very uncomfortable to wear...they almost feel like you have them on backwards they seem restrictive in areas. If I hadn't already washed them I would return them. I would avoid these shirts in the future."
"A Reviewer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Neck is too loose, rides up digging into my neck. Shirt is too long, so it grabs and pulls the shirt down. Generally bad fit."
"Jeremy H.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Comparing to the last time I bought these, these are garbage. Even after washing and stressing, they are uncomfortable and scratchy as all get out. I cannot stand these and will never buy them again. Which is a shame, because the original bunch I bought were my goto black cotton shirts."
"See Jay","1.0 out of 5 stars","Absolutely counterfeit. I've been wearing the real comfort soft shirts for years. These are not even close. Not only do they lack the correct tags and stitching. The fabric is way to heavy and scratchy.
Do not buy"
"ableable","1.0 out of 5 stars","Disappointing, because the color is not very dark. I ordered ""black"" and they are black but they aren't a deep or dark black, they are more like a pale-colored black, and that makes the shirts look washed-out even before the first washing. Also the packaging was a bit unusual in that the T-shirts were in a clear sealed plastic bag, without any labeling/marking at all. They were not in ""Hanes"" traditional packaging. I wouldn't buy them again, not because of the packaging, but because of the off-putting color."
"JN","1.0 out of 5 stars","This is a good undershirt except for the iron-on label in the back. If you have never been irritated by labels causing you to scratch you back all day then this shirt is good. For me, the label is irritating on the first wear and after a few times in drier starts to flake and the irritation is simply unbearable. If they made the same shirt with a standard label that could be cut off then this review would be a 5 but the irritating and non-removable label causes me to wear the shirt inside out."
"Nilbog","1.0 out of 5 stars","Other Heather shirts that I have feel nice comfortable and soft. This is just a rough material not soft whatsoever."
"Ashma","1.0 out of 5 stars","The item is not worth it. It’s not tagless, it’s not what I expected form Hanes, being the company they are. All my shirts were different size,length, and style. Now keep in mind there were all small, but looked like and felt like large, extra large, and medium. I’m very disappointed in Amazon and this company. If your looking to purchase t-shirts that are Hanes go to the Hanes store or choose another vendor.
Never again
Thanks Amazon"
"neilio","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not what expected. coarse fabric. Can I block offerings from this vendor in the future? Why would anyone want a t-shirt like this. underhanded vendor"
"K.T.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought them oversized for sleep shirts and they are so scratchy, so uncomfortable after 3 washes. Very disappointed."
"TJ","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered these in large size and they are way too small, not at all like the large Hanes Comfortsoft that I bought from Wal-Mart. They are like a cheap made t-shirt with the Hanes logo. Also, they are heavy and not the thin undershirt like I was expecting by the description. I thought this was a better deal at the time but wasn't worth it. I should have took more time reading through the reviews but I figured, how much different can it be from the same brand in the stores."
"Kathy","1.0 out of 5 stars","Awful! They looked a little big and smelled funny out of the package. I popped them in the washer and dryer.... they shrunk more than two sizes! No way these will fit now. I'm so disappointed! Literally shrunk to nothing!"
"Mark Van","1.0 out of 5 stars","UPDATE: Washed these over and over with fabric softener to no avail. Still scratchy and irritating. I’ve had many a Hanes T-shirt and these definitely are not HANES COMFORT T-SHIRTS! —-I have to say these are not like the shirts I purchased from a local store. They are not as soft and even after washing 3 times are a bit scratchy."
"Ryan Hartley - Video Editor","1.0 out of 5 stars","Do you like a full body hug from a cactus? Good! These aren’t the same Hanes black pocket t shirts I ordered prior times. This shirt feels like crap! Cheap, bad quality, poorly made, no pocket."
"The904","1.0 out of 5 stars","As many others have said, these shirts are a KNOCK OFF. Please do not buy these.
They are not tag less and appear to be cheaply made. Comfort Soft isn't mentioned anywhere at all."
"eric salamon","1.0 out of 5 stars","i bought these to wear ""underneath"" my other shirts/garments......not to stick out the bottom of what i am wearing over it."
"daniel obrien","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts were very thin and see through. You can easily see my nipples through them which is obviously not desirable in a shirt. No where did they advertise that they were see through. Very cheap and thin material on the plain white medium shirts I ordered, I returned them."
"Nicole P.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I'm very unhappy with this purchase. I've ordered Hanes comfort soft before and they were great. Size M is true to size. I bought them again from Amazon and these are not Hanes and not comfort soft. They are heavy weight and scratchy and humongous for a size M. They are more of an XL and seem to be a knock off..."
"Joseph","1.0 out of 5 stars","bad quality. not usual hanes. somthing off with fit feel size and quality. as well as the tag and packaging"
"Bethmostdays","1.0 out of 5 stars","I think I received a knock off because while it does have a tear away tag it does NOT have the hanes logo that is on every tagless item they sell. All mine has printed on the shirt is XL/TG/XG made in HAITI BUT NO HANES LOGO. Even the picture of the product you can see the logo printed on the shirt. Itso also supposed to be a comfort shirt but it's real rough and scratchy. The XL is more like a 2xl."
"cbseattle","1.0 out of 5 stars","I was hoping that it would feel like cotton since it claims to be 99% cotton, but it feels like polyester. Very disappointed."
"DJ","1.0 out of 5 stars","I believe that these shirts are not authentic Hanes. They arrived folded oddly in a clear plastic bag, not in any type of hanes packaging. The material is thick and not soft at all and they had weird lint all over them. As far as the fit goes, they shrunk considerably which I was expecting. They are very narrow but very long."
"Jim","1.0 out of 5 stars","You want to buy shirts with loose threads and necks that are way too large out of the box, these are for you."
"Ghost","1.0 out of 5 stars","I purchased this because I love to wear Hanes, they're comfortable and typically have good longevity. These how ever, ALL shrunk after 1 wash to a size that was uncomfortable to wear, very disappointed. Compared to my other Hanes, these have a little tag that says ""Hanes"" when the real brand doesn't even use a tag anymore.... do not buy."
"Seth Merrill","1.0 out of 5 stars","Don’t put these in the dryer! What happened to preshrunk? I can’t wear these and I knew it after wearing the very first one. They are almost perfect and then if you wash and dry them they shrink to the point that it won’t cover your torso if you raise your arms passed your shoulders"
"Mom","1.0 out of 5 stars","Are these childrens size? Very very small. My husband wears a medium. These would fit a ten year old."
"Radioflyer55","1.0 out of 5 stars","Somehow this product was misleading, it describes as Comfortsoft but it's not. It feels scratchy.
It came in plastic bag not original packaging as value pack like the ones you'll find in Walmart.
It has a tag which you can remove but I was expecting a tagless, comfortsoft t-shirts."
"Andrew T.","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts are NOT tagless nor are they the comfortsoft shirts the description stated."
"LIN C","1.0 out of 5 stars","I put them in the washer before use and after the dryer, what were XL size turned into a small. What a tip off. Will be using tmas shop rags now."
"Nick Charles","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these shirts because they were cotton ""ComfortSoft"". The fabric is very thin and quite scratchy. It is not comfortable at all. Also the shirts were larger than I expected. They were a very loose fit. These shirts are going back."
"MT","1.0 out of 5 stars","As you can see there are bugs in my package. I ordered this package a few weeks ago and I hadn’t opened it yet. I bought it for PE at school. These might be moth larvae."
"Neal","1.0 out of 5 stars","The first time i ordered these they were comfortsoft tagless tshirts. This time there was a tag and it did not say comfortsoft. Also, i washed them before wearing them and noticed that they shrunk alot more than the ones I have purchased in the past. Dehinatley not the same tshirt!!! Will go to Walmart or Target from now on so I can put my hands on them. Sorry Amazon"
"MDJ","1.0 out of 5 stars","I did not want the heavyweight shirts! I was so furious after they were already washed and I put one on. The heavyweight shirts are no different, or better, than a gildan or basic cheap shirt. These are not comfortsoft by any means, very rough and rigid."
"molly","1.0 out of 5 stars","Hanes used to make really good tshirts. The Hanes 'perfect t' really was a perfect shirt, soft and cut well. Then they discontinued it. No idea why. Then they made the 'comfort soft' t shirt, 90/10 blend. It was still pretty good. But now their comfort soft 90/10 blend is poor quality, not soft at all, very scratchy, feels almost like 100% polyester, and is cut weird. Def not for american body style. Don't know why no one can make soft cotton shirts anymore. weird."
"Heavyweight rags","1.0 out of 5 stars","So it says comfort soft T shirt in the title. Walmart has been out of stock. They are tagless at Walmart. Also these are heavy weight. I should have read the entire description down at the bottom. Who has that kind of time. It should have stated that in the top description. Rags... just rags. Misleading and I’m done with Hanes. Why tags and tagless heavy weight light weight. Feels like your unloading old outdated stock."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","NOT COMFORT SOFT SHIRTS . I'LL keep them and use them for work . I'll take a ride to WALMART and get Fruit of the Loom"
"stephen s.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Two of the shirts had extremely bad sewing on the sleeves. It made it feel like the shirt was on backwards so they will end up being thrown out or sleeves cut off."
"Brad","1.0 out of 5 stars","These t-shirts creep up in the front while being worn, putting pressure on the front of my neck. I'll start to wonder if I put it on backward, but then I'll see the ""tag"" in back. They are the least comfortable t-shirts I have ever worn. They don't feel right. They are shaped kind of strangely, not meant for a male human's body. I have to stretch them in various places after putting them on, because they feel so weird. Are these t-shirts meant for aliens or perhaps an animal?"
"G. G.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Been wearing Hanes ComfortSoft for quite a while, and they're good, but I never bought from Amazon. Ordered these in black and they were good quality, so I ordered them in ash. One wash and they shrank to one size smaller. Annoyed that quality control for Amazon products would be so undependable."
"Leonardo Torres","1.0 out of 5 stars","Very surprised and disappointed with this pack of shirts, I wore the tee shirt maybe once and i notice holes under the arm on the seam it came apart 3 outta the 4 tee shirts. Now i got to think about order them on line again first time this happen not worth sending them back. made in Honduras everything you buy now is made outside of the USA.."
"enxo","1.0 out of 5 stars","cheap shirt.. im not a beefy body trying to fit into a 'small/tight' tee.. the fit is loose, i pulled the shirt to adjust it and tuck it in? and the seams at the sleeve popped... dumb. poorly made. must be knock offs? idk. not worth the dime."
"Treybien","1.0 out of 5 stars","The fabric of the shirts I received is rough and thick. Luckily, I bought them with bonus points, so I will give them to charity and buy some good shirts from a company with better quality control. The Hanes Perfect T set the standard for me - too bad that it is no longer available and the ones I have are almost all worn out."
"Leila","1.0 out of 5 stars","Imitation hanes, not real quality"
"Cameron SK","1.0 out of 5 stars","I've purchased this brand and style numerous times. What I got was not the correct fabric, fit or even cut. There was even extra fabric hanging off of it on the shoulder. Disappointed. If I could give it a 0 I would."
"I am Jayjay","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not comfort soft"
"Beatnik","1.0 out of 5 stars","Opened, washed and wore four hours and stitching is already falling apart. Fabric is making fuzz balls. Hard to buy online and know if you're getting counterfit product, but I doubt Hanes made these."
"Chris","1.0 out of 5 stars","I've bought these about 10 times now and wondered why I kept having to buy them again. After comparing a new one with one that I washed once in cold water and dried in low heat, it shrank about 2 and 1/2 inches from top to bottom, over 3/4 inches on the sleeves. My suggestion is to buy in a size larger."
"Ryan P","1.0 out of 5 stars","These were not Hanes Comfort Soft t-shirts. They are evidently knock offs. They come with a tag and the material is not th same as my other Hanes Comfort Softt-shirts (purchased at Wal-Mart). I will be sending these back."
"Scott McPartland","1.0 out of 5 stars","Total garbage knock off item. NOT Hanes at all even though cheap looking tag said ""Hanes"". Arrived in a generic see through plastic bag with NO name on it. Shrunk after the first wash, and material felt like sand paper on me."
"D. Mendez","1.0 out of 5 stars","Total knock off. Not Hanes Comfortsoft as advertised. These are made in the Dominican republic and are of extremely poor quality and NOT tagless (see photo) If you're looking for the Comfortsoft line, keep looking because these ARE NOT IT!"
"DC","1.0 out of 5 stars","Pictures say its a Hanes 5280 which is a tagless shirt. These showed up with a Hanes tag and then a screen printed tag with no brand. These can't be real Hanes shirts. Either way. Not as what's described."
"Kindle Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Terrible material; feels like flexible cardboard, but not as comfortable. I was already mad at my son so I gave the shirts to him."
"Magdaly","1.0 out of 5 stars","This is not Hanes. It came with a tag, but it is supposed to be tagless. Granted, it was a hanes tag but it coukd have been added after the fact.
Amazon needs to shut these guys down!"
"o","1.0 out of 5 stars","These t shirts were advertised as ""Hanes Comfort Soft"" Tees. What arrived is a pack of t-shirts in plain plastic wrapping. The large tag says ""hanes"", that's it. Hanes comfort soft tees are printed inside the collar that they are comfort soft. T-shirts were okay... but thin."
"Big Dave","1.0 out of 5 stars","Thought these would be better made than Fruit of the Loom stuff from Walmart...but more expensive and worse quality."
"Just an opinion","1.0 out of 5 stars","The fabric feels scratchy and uncomfortable. I washed them in cold water and dried them on low heat and they still shrunk to size small and therefore unwearable to me."
"spencerc6","1.0 out of 5 stars","I thought I ordered pocket tees. These are not. My mistake. But they are HUGE. If you need an emergency natural disaster tent, buy a pack of these. Spray them with whichever waterproofing liquid you prefer, and store them til you need an emergency shelter."
"Dee Dyer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not soft at all. My husband wears a medium. Even the extra large was tOo small. Junk"
"Britney L","1.0 out of 5 stars","After 1 wash the shirts lose 6 inches in length. The shirts aren’t soft. Will purchase different brand next time as I wear these as undershirts everyday for work. Unless you like belly shirts."
"J. Doyle","1.0 out of 5 stars","These T-Shirts were not only incorrectly labeled but were shipped in a rolled up ball and thrown into an unmarked envelope with no evidence of any Hanes packaging - only the ink printed on the fabric. I have been buying Hanes for 30 years and never have I received something in this manner and never has a large been made as large as these t-shirts."
"bookygrams","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought the 4x, which is what my son wears. The shirts are small (maybe 3x at most), the neck is too small (it cchokes) and it barely covers his stomach. What a joke!"
"Brian Cochran","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered a size big to allow for shirking and it fits good. But I rated this so low because it said it was 100% cotton. That is the only reason I bought it as my job has to have that for saftey reasons. I had already washed them when I seen the tag and there not even close to 100% cotton."
"jefferzbooboo","1.0 out of 5 stars","Buyer beware, these are cheap knock offs. They came in a clear plastic bag."
"S. Gray","1.0 out of 5 stars","These weren't soft and the label said 50% cotton, 50% polyester. They felt like it. I sent them back and will continue buying thrift store t-shirts to sleep in."

"Kenneth f.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have bought Hanes t shirts before and was happy with them but these are garbage,so far two of them have started to unravel when wearing with the threads unraveling and now i have a big hole in the underside of the sleeves so i won't be buying these again."

Got them in today, unboxed them and at 1st sight I new these were fake. Made in Honduras REALLY and it feels like I have sandpaper on for a shirt. It's to much of a hassle to send these back so I'll use them as rags. AMAZON please stop allowing folks to sell fake stuff on Amazon......."

"ghostreapr","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are NOT 100% cotton as stated. Very disappointed in the misleading description. It makes me very leery of ordering clothes of any type from Amazon ever again.
Walmart or somewhere else will get my business for clothes."

"CJ","1.0 out of 5 stars","These were advertised as soft, 100% cotton shirts. Upon receipt, I found they were partially polyester and very scratchy. I have returned them. I'll plan to go looking for soft shirts like this in person where I can evaluate the quality in person before I buy."

"Bill Vecchio Jr.","1.0 out of 5 stars","I don’t know if you’ve ever worn a Hanes comfort fit T-shirt before but they are soft, a normal thickness, and fit perfectly. These are cheap knockoffs that are not soft, thicker than comfort fit t’s, and are wider and shorter than the comfortfits you buy in the store. Do not be fooled."
"Will fuentes","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirt fits fine everywhere but the neck and shoulders. It feels like it was not stitched correctly. It is the worst shirt I have ever owned."
"Tricia Ramkissoon","1.0 out of 5 stars","It was not what I was expecting. The material was rough and stiff. Not soft as the details claim. Buy your size. Not one up or down. Your size will fit."
"Chris","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not Hanes ComfortSoft®. They're rough on your skin and obviously fake. The tags are paper with a weird font that says Hanes-- and it easily rips off when you pull on it."
"Chris W.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Hems of two of the shirts came completely unraveled in first wash. Shirts are very stiff feeling, even after washing. Would not recommend."
"HiveTyrant36","1.0 out of 5 stars","These initially were very comfortable and seemed like decent shirts... until I washed them.... They went from 5x to 2x in one load. DO NOT BUY."
"Karl","1.0 out of 5 stars","Very different from other Hanes t-shirts I have purchased off line. The fabric is not as black as others, but more importantly, the length is two inches shorter than other Hanes shirts of the same size. The tail keeps pulling out of my jeans. Other than price, I can't think of any reason to recommend these."
"charlie","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts are not black they are gray first off and after you wash one time they shrink alot i have always got good stuff off Amazon but i will never buy off Q mall again"
"Buzznot","1.0 out of 5 stars","This is the worst Hane's product i have ever bought I am not sure they will be decent rags."
"Steven F.","1.0 out of 5 stars","For a product labeled ComfortSoft, Hanes really drops the ball. Out of the packaging these shirts are stiff and scratchy, after a wash they've hardly improved and the thinness of the fabric has shown itself. You get what you pay for I guess."
"D Lloyd","1.0 out of 5 stars","Bought navy shirts from Aristan Group. Not as advertised. Large tags with Heavyweight name. Not liker e the other tagless ones I've bought. Had until Nov 18 to ship return. Today, November 18th the label is not available to print. Guess I learned my lesson. Ship returns promptly. I'm out $14."
"Talia","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are the worst. There is nothing comfortsoft about them. I’ve bought these before and they were great, not sure what changed. Itchy and uncomfortable the moment you have them on. The tag is softer than the shirt itself. Buy something else."
"Darwine","1.0 out of 5 stars","The product is really rough it even cause my nipple to chaff would not recommend."
"Doc1103","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirt fits but it was never listed that they were short. I am in the navy and I use it as a uniform under shirt and it does not fit an average sized person in terms of length. It pops out of the back"

Two had holes or missing stitching, and three of them didn't fit right (collar too small, sleeves too long, and/or shirt too short). I don't expect the remaining three to last more than a few months. Hanes used to be a decent quality brand but these were the last items I'll ever buy from them."

"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","I wish I could emphasize this comment. Total wast of money. It’s not soft and it shrunk like crazy at first wash XL to M. Figured I’d use it to clean my car, but pretty much fell apart for that. Don’t buy it."
"Mike","1.0 out of 5 stars","Don’t waste your money. The shirts are not comfortable and they shrunk almost two sizes after 1 wash. Worthless junk."

They are thick ((HOT)) and hard even after being washed multiple times!!"
"Gagandeep","1.0 out of 5 stars","The fabric shrunk after the first wash, I would not recommend anyone buying this product. The t-shirt is unwearable, I am now using this cloth for cleaning my apartment."

"Kai","1.0 out of 5 stars","CHEAP MATERIAL. SUPER ITCHY. CAME WITH TAGS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Fake fake fake"
"Katlaind Brooke","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are not soft whatsoever. I’m not picky, normally any T-shirt is fine for me.. but these shirts are so rough, stiff and uncomfortable. I washed them and they still feel awful. I’ll probably just end up donating them. Very disappointed!"
"wade hendrix","1.0 out of 5 stars","These were notComfort Soft and clearly a misrepresentation of the product.The fabric didn't feel like them and I'm surprised that people get by selling things that aren't what they were supposed to be. I've worn them since Hanes came out with them and they just don't wear the same.Amazon evidently doesn't care what crap is sold on their site or they would stop these people from ripping off their customers."
"Joseph Daxberger","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought this pack of shirts 25 days ago. I thought the tags looked a little suspect as soon as I opened them up, and now one of them has ripped in the armpit, and as you can see in the photo, the bottom hem has already opened up on another. These shirts have only been washed twice."
"J. Pinson","1.0 out of 5 stars","This product is advertised in the pictures as being 100% cotton. In the description, it’s advertised as 90% cotton. Printed on the shirt, maybe 50% cotton, 50% polyester. Hanes doesn’t make a comfortsoft tee shirt that’s 50% cotton."
"Akip","1.0 out of 5 stars","Tad on the small size, these are knock offs and are not Hanes Ts...they have a tag though they claim to be “tagless”"
"Ri Gel","1.0 out of 5 stars","The item came with some damages especially on the armpits. It is WAY TOO LARGE and clearly this is not the same as the ones I purchased at the store. I am 100% sure that these are FAKE. I strongly suggest NOT TO BUY this stuff."
"Ian Douglas","1.0 out of 5 stars","Obvious fake or counterfeit shirts. Nothing like actual even though sold by Amazon.com. Ripped off. Poor quality and has a generic tag whereas actual has tag info printed on shirt. Will be returning."
"Chris H.","1.0 out of 5 stars","The sleeves are way too long. Undershirts should not have sleeves that hit the elbow. I'm 6'2"" and have long arms. Wow, the sleeves are long. I expect undershirts to hit the halfway mark."
"A Shopper","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have to agree with some of the other reviewer about them shrinking. I bought XL and they fit fine till I washed them. I always wash my cloths in cold water and dry on low heat but when I washed these, they shrunk so much I can't tuck them in. I would not buy them again. The quality is very poor."
"Poltalian31","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not soft!!! It says ""comfort soft HEAVYWEIGHT"" on the printed tag. I never would've ordered these if I had known. Now I can't return because I opened it. Misleading description."
"Kevin Thueringer","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are terrible. Unfortunately for me I was gone for a while after I received these and now that I have tried the shirts my return window has passed. These shirts are like sand paper. They are extremely rough and uncomfortable. I tried to wash and dry them to see if they would get softer, but they don't. They where shipped loose without any packaging, box, bag, nothing, just 4 folded shirts. I have had hanes shirts before that were fine, these are not fine. They might be fakes. DO NOT BUY THEM."
"Donna","1.0 out of 5 stars","Taking the t-shirts out of the package there was a terrible smell, tried washing the shirts and the smell didn't go away would not even give them to the Goodwill - they are now in the trash - beware don't purchase them"

"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shirts sold and shipped by Amazon are extremely misleading.
These Hanes shirts are advertised as a tear away tag. The shirts are not tear away tag. The tag is stamped in the shirt. Extremely disappointing to be mislead."
"Josh","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts didnt come in a hanes package and they do not feel like the same material as other Hanes shirts that I have bought. They also appear to be sewn wrong, as though neither side is the front. So no matter what it feels like it is on backwards."
"LifeLibertyHappiness","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts I received did not have the Hanes Comfortsoft taggless label. I have purchased this brand from stores in the past and loved it, but the product I received does not have the Comfortsoft label and they felt heavyweight and scratchy. The picture they have advertised for this product has the Comfortsoft label, but that is not what they sent. I am returning it because it is not soft at all."
"J.D. Cooper","1.0 out of 5 stars","why are all shirts made for 7 foot basketball players. nothing for shorty me to buy."
"Harvey","1.0 out of 5 stars","Poor quality. Stiff material. Did not fit."
"John","1.0 out of 5 stars","Love my other Hanes black t-shirts. These are very different. Thicker, not as soft and an odd tight chest cut. Even the packaging was odd as they were loose in the packaging meaning no inside packaging. 100% these were knock offs and not real Hanes brand... John"
"Duane Meadows","1.0 out of 5 stars","This supposed 4-pack of shirts showed up and there's only 2 shirts."
"Cyber Buckeye","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirt fit as expected, but the material was not very comfortable at all. Very rough and not soft. I am looking for soft black undershirts for my workshirts and I thought these would work but they did not. I did return them and the return was hassle free."
"Lisa Juhring","1.0 out of 5 stars","Don't know what these are, but they are not Hanes ComfortSoft shirts. The tag has no information, other than 'Hanes'. No listing of the % cotton and % polyester. No tag or marking that says ""ComfortSoft"". These seriously need to be removed from Amazon."
"Simply Mi","1.0 out of 5 stars","I specifically ordered these because the description indicated that they had a tear-a-way tag. That was a lie!!!! I need these TODAY and now they can not be used."
"Sam smith","1.0 out of 5 stars","Cotton super rough even after wash don’t think theses are real Hanes"

"Dave Carney","1.0 out of 5 stars","Got a pack of XL shirts... 6 in the pack.... 2 fit, 1 is close to being too small and the other 3 arw worn comfortably by my son who wears med to larhe shirts. Ripoff. Never had this prob with jockey brand which I've been buying from kohls for about 6 years now."
"Brian B","1.0 out of 5 stars","I reordered this as it was a convenient 4-pack of thick, white, cotton t-shirts with no tags; the label is printed and doesnt scratch your neck. Not sure how I then ended up with only 1 t-shirt with a tag."

"Crystal","1.0 out of 5 stars","Knock offs. Not Hanes Comfort Tee. And it comes in a regular plastic bag, not retail packaging."
"Kimmy B","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are terrible. The fit is weird - they are reallllly wide, and short. They almost seem like irregulars or factory errors. I assumed they would be “normal” shirts and didn’t open them for a while, but I should have opened and returned immediately - now the return window has “closed”. Two thumbs down."
"Sydney","1.0 out of 5 stars","This product is a bootleg product. Real hanes are already preshrunk. These didn't last 1 time through the washer before popping seams and shrinking down a whole size. Total waste of money!"
"Sam H.","1.0 out of 5 stars","The product image and description are incorrect. The description says the shirts have “tear away” tags. The images also show tags. However the shirts I received do not have tags. The Hanes logo has been printed directly on the t-shirt."

"mcls2008","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not like the ComfortSoft shirts of the past. They are heavy, tight, and itchy. The cotton is of low quality and the weave it bad. After several washes, they haven't softened up at all, and I refuse to wear them."
"Diane","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts did not match the description- we have bought Hanes “Comfortsoft” t-shirts in the store- these were not the same at all. Fit was not the same and fabric was not the same- and they had a tag rather than the imprint.
We were not satisfied and returned them."
"Jay Man","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not the comfort soft shirts."
"Michael Zimmerman","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are a counterfeit or spurious reproduction of a Hanes comfortsoft. I'm very disappointed in Amazon for allowing this practice. The package was stuffed to the brim with shirts not in original packaging typical of OEM Hanes shirts. The label also did not specify the material included in the shirt, which I believe is required by FTC law. I'm also pretty sure all comfortsoft shirts are tagless, or at least the ones I have bought for the last several years have been. I'm no detective dan but these are fakes. Don't waste your money."
"Casey","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered both black and whit tees. Neither were ComfortSoft. One was simply Hanes Tagless and the other plain Hanes tees. This is an embarrassing disappointment from Amazon."
"Sheryl L. Phillips","1.0 out of 5 stars","I'm very disappointed. The quality of these shirts is NOT what they used to be. They're made of thin fabric which doesn't seem to want to keep a shape--even BEFORE the first washing! This isn't the Hanes shirt of several years ago."
"michael","1.0 out of 5 stars","Like others have mentioned, these are not real Hanes t shirts. The fabric feels horrible! Would not recommend!"
"MattM-","1.0 out of 5 stars","Been wearing Hanes T-shirts for over 15 years.
Although in the photos; last page it says tagless... it is not. YES THERE ARE TAGS. These are not ""comfort soft"" very stiff material. Almost abrasive to the skin. Cheap knockoff. If they are in fact Hanes T-shirts, they are not the comfort soft material. Does not come in hanes packaging.
Not authentic. SCAMMER"
"Guerra Household","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not what expected. Has a tag, it’s itchy, not soft, feels like sandpaper, not cotton at all. Do not buy, very very poor quality."
"Larry L.","1.0 out of 5 stars","These t-shirts are too thick and too hot. They are about three times thicker than what I was expecting. I hate these shirts because I can't wear them since they are so hot. They might be OK for someone living at the North Pole!"
"johnathon stamps","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not what it's described and had black thread sewed in the armpit area of the shirt like really all I wanted was some comfortsoft Hanes ordered v-necks came they were perfect ordered he's thinking the same thing no.hope if you're buying this item you read the reviews before you buy it I wish I did."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","They're too large and the texture feels more papery rather than cottony like you would expect, would not recommend. I wish I could send them back but I gave two of the shirts away so it's too late. Don't buy!"
"Stephen Hogan","1.0 out of 5 stars","These were made in Haiti, have neck tags, and definitely look illegitimate. TShirt sizing was completely off and had a huge neckline. Returning for a refund."
"T.S.","1.0 out of 5 stars","These undershirts are not what Hanes used to be. They are all different sizes, extremely thin like cheese cloth, and are rough and itchy. I've worn wool sweaters that are more comfortable, no lie. I've been wearing Hanes for as along as I can remember, and I'm 34. The quality has gone far down hill. I was really hoping these would be as good as in the past. Not so. Save your money and find another brand."
"Haley Harris","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are basic shirts. They aren’t the comfortsoft that I was looking for. False advertising. This product is horrible"
"Italodml","1.0 out of 5 stars","After the first machine wash the shirts shrunk the length really bad. I’m 5’10” 230 pounds, my wife says the shirts looks like a crop top on me now. to me they are useless now"
"Amanda Weisbrod","1.0 out of 5 stars","I wanted to wear these as pajama shirts but even after I washed them (with plenty of fabric softener, too) they felt stiff and scratchy. I ended up giving them to my boyfriend who doesn’t mind them but I was really disappointed."
"California Shopper","1.0 out of 5 stars","If you ended up on this product by searching for soft tshirt, then move along, nothing to see here.

"Eric B.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Is not comfort soft. Everyday tee"
"Michelle White","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shrinkage is ridiculous. I washed them before the first wear. They shrunk down to a size small and I had to just give them away. Not good."
"Joseph","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts are not 100% Cotton as stated in the Hanes banner on web page (feel like mostly polyester)"
"David Wright","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have bought Hanes online a few times, from different vendors. Each time the fit is different. I buy 99.9% of my items online. Since I wear Hanes daily, I will not be buying them online anymore. Always a different thickness of material, length, and cut. Not consistent at all. I do not recommended buying this product online."
"Tyler","1.0 out of 5 stars","Description says tagless, these have tags on neck... and don't say comfortsoft anywhere.. Not at all like the picture or description"
"Bret","1.0 out of 5 stars","I purchased these T's beacause I have trusted Hanes for years. Unfortunately the ones I received were not what I expected. They had an extremely uncomfortable tag sewn in when now days tag information is printed on. The worst part is that when I washed them, they all turned yellow. I'm not sure if these are just very old authentic Hanes shirts or if they are fakes. Either way, I would advise anyone who is interested in purchasing these to look elsewhere."
"cbf","1.0 out of 5 stars","Quite a bad t shirt. First complaint is that these shirts are too short. I am 5'10 and the bottom is at the top of my waist. If I straighten and arm or bend down the shirt will raise to about navel level. Second complaint is that they shrink more than any other t shirt Ive ever worn."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered Comfortsoft and that is not what I recieved. Plain old tshirts that are 99 % cotton. Now I feel like I'm stuck with them as I need them for work and dont have enough time to order more to arrive by Monday. Shame on ypu!"
"short hair","1.0 out of 5 stars","The shirts fit fine. The quality on the other hand is terrible, by the 3rd wash all the seams are coming apart with holes in the arm pit seams. Junk"
"Scott","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not Comfortsoft. I have Haynes comfortsoft bought from Target and these are not it."
"Charlie","1.0 out of 5 stars","Order a size smaller than you usually would, ordered a pack of the 2xl and they are way bigger than a normal 2xl"
"Richard","1.0 out of 5 stars","Sweating in the shirt causes it to change color to a orange rather then light sand colored. Not a good idea if you want a sand colored shirt."
"Lbrittain85","1.0 out of 5 stars","To small"
"Nate LeClair","1.0 out of 5 stars","NOT HANES COMFORTSOFT TEES, if you’re looking for comfortsoft tees in a big size or any size at all for that matter don’t buy these, heck don’t buy these at all. Just a big scam, go on the Hanes website and buy a 4 pack for $21. It’s well worth the wait, these are just a cheap knockoff."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Undershirts should be soft, these are like wearing burlap bags! Awful and rough!!"
"Lahiru Caldera","1.0 out of 5 stars","Worst shirts ever. Cheap material, shrinks one size after 1st wash and continues on throughout each wash. I'm a medium and my brother who wears small end up taking them. After he washed them they were too small for him. Now my mom use them as dusting rags. Thanks a lot Michael Jordan. Knew Hanes was crappy brand before you put your name on it when advertised. News Flash: Hanes is crappier than ever. Only difference is they print the tag on the shirt kept the savings and tod the customers they did it for customers cumfort. Not really more like to save few hundread million dollars in shirt tags and pay that money to Jordan to lie to his loyal customers. Well done Hanes."
"Walter Dane Colwell","1.0 out of 5 stars","Purchased the 4-pk in black. These are NOT ComfortSoft, in fact they are not like any Hanes I've ever bought. In a plain plastic bag with no brand markings. Very coarse scratchy material, bottom seam rolls up. Suitable for rags."
"H. Keith Skipper","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ORDERED HANES BLACK T SHIRTS WITH POCKETS-THE 2X SIZE WAS CORRECT=-THESE 4 WERE CHARCOL WITHOUT POCKETS-I'VE ORDERED 65 OR MORE BLACK WITH POCKES -NEVER CHARCOAL WITHOUT POCKETS.

"MARTY","1.0 out of 5 stars","Although advertised as comfort cotton, the material was rough and scratchy.
I tried to return, but the company would not pay for return postage, and the postage was almost the price of the shirts. So I'm not sure what to do. Regift them, I guess."

"Joshua Speers","1.0 out of 5 stars","Product received was not the same as the one shown here and appeared to be a counterfeit. Came with no care instructions, and the shirts shrunk enough after the first wash that they are now too small."
"Larry Irvine","1.0 out of 5 stars","I suspect these were ‘talks’ but not labeled as such.
Unable to wear with short sleeve shirts.
Unhappy."
"James M Campora","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not comfort soft Hanes T’s. Mine came with tags that look like they are knock-offs and not genuine Hanes. Don’t buy them. I bought the actual comfort T’s a year ago and they are soft right out of the package are tagless, say comfort soft right on them. I should have just returned them and not washed them. Will use as rags now. Terrible. Beware of this vendor."
"Colin","1.0 out of 5 stars","Scratchy, rough. The medium is closer to a large in size, these are significantly larger than other Hanes plain white tees I have ordered. I wish it was more apparent in the product description that these are very thick shirts. They're so thick it makes them unsuitable for t-shirt weather."
"JWP","1.0 out of 5 stars","I have hanes comfortsoft t-shirts in the past and have been very happy. These ones are trash. My old shirts that are size M are longer then these, (Size Large) and softer. Either these are counterfeit Hanes or Hanes' quality as gone down to that of rags."
"Clinton L. Armstrong","1.0 out of 5 stars","Product has shrunk in the wash 40% more then older products of the same brand style. Shirts are not as soft as previously purchased shirt. I do not wear as a result."

"Calvin","1.0 out of 5 stars","The quality is different from what you would buy in Walmart or Target. I bought an XL and after washing them they are now a wide large. So instead of fitting a tall skinny person, they now fit a short larger person. The fabric is also extremely rough and not soft at all. Are these the defective Hanes shirts that don't make it stores?"

"slipangle","1.0 out of 5 stars","The fabric is very rough. They have faded quickly. The collar doesn't lay flat. It's all bunched up. These must be knock-offs. I have some of these that I bought at Target and they are perfect. Not sure what's going on these from Amazon."
"Walter Page III","1.0 out of 5 stars","Cheap product"
"Beau Butcher","1.0 out of 5 stars","They fit like I needed them too but the thread started coming out of them either at the collar or the arm pit area or at the bottom of the shirts. I bought five shirts just a few weeks ago and now I am down to one shirt. Not happy at all."
"Max Minutiae","1.0 out of 5 stars","Very misleading to call them “comfort soft.” My fault for believing that."
"Jon","1.0 out of 5 stars","I couldnt answer the above questions , becaue they were t-shirts rejected at time of manufacture and sold online , I've worn Hanes for 20 years now , those were NOT a Hanes product . Fit was just wrong , neck , underarms , thru shoulders , like a trainee made them ."
"Josiah Chappell","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are definitely not original Hanes ComfortSoft shirts. The shirts didn’t come in any Hanes packaging, they also do not have any Hanes logos on them. Looks like an offbrand cheap shirt that’s being marketed incorrectly"
"Corey Lewandowski","1.0 out of 5 stars","I'm not sure exactly what they are trying to pass off here as Hanes ComfortSoft but these are not the same material as my other Hanes ComfortSoft tee shirts.

Not a quality product...DO NOT BUY"

"VICTOR H.","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not the same quality as the same brand sold in stores. Very cheap , the neck starts to deform after one wash."
"Brandon","1.0 out of 5 stars","The description says these are comfortsoft shirts, but when I tried them on they did not compare to any Hanes comfortsoft shirts that I have bought in the past. Soft is the last thing I thought of while wearing these shirts."
"Mel","1.0 out of 5 stars","Doesn't say ComfortSoft and isn't soft. A rip-off and a bummer, but I needed black shirts right away so I couldn't return in time to get something else. Skip these shirts; they have a misleading description, as other reviewers have noted."

"Debra","1.0 out of 5 stars","They fit before I washed so I washed in cold and they shrunk up so bad it was crazy!! Never buy again and find it hard to believe they are Hanes since I have never had that problem with their product before."
"OsoDeAnteojos","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts shrink too much.
Pros:
Color
Cons:
They shrank with the first wash
Too small for what I'm use to in other brands
Not too confortable
I would not recommend this product to any one."

"Jensen Coffey","1.0 out of 5 stars","Both the fit and the fabric were subpar. Not the same Hanes quality I usually buy at Target. I’m very disappointed with the quality and will most likely donate these shirts, as I’ve already washed them and can’t return."

"AWK","1.0 out of 5 stars","I received a fake or counterfeit item. It was supposed to be comfortsoft and tagless per description. As you can see from the pics, it’s neither and I’m fairly sure it’s not even an actual Hanes product."

"colonthreec","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shirts are 50% polyester, 50% cotton, not the mix identified. Very irritating to the skin"
"R. Bowman","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shrank considerable for first 3 washes in cold"
"Meeds","1.0 out of 5 stars","Terrible fabric. Seems like a knockoff to me. Stiff fabric. Not soft. Fits like a box, and neck comes out a very odd shape in the wash. A complete waste."
"D C","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not 100% cotton. Seems like false advertising and makes me hesitant to buy anything now if the company isn't held to a standard of proper disclosure."
"Steven M. Jones","1.0 out of 5 stars","Went from a large to a medium when washed."
"Ed","1.0 out of 5 stars","wow these actually suck. I had the comfortblend shirt before and that is softer compared to this trash. Should have known better and actually went to a store to buy the shirts I want. These are just VERY uncomfortable to wear"

"William Donato","1.0 out of 5 stars","All the shirts fit differently, some have cloth cut so wrong that the shirts won’t fit at all. I think these are counterfeit , they do not have Hanes logos."
"Chloe","1.0 out of 5 stars","They are very small. I ordered a large- definitely does not fit like a large, more like a medium to small. I’d order a size up. They also shrink A LOT. They aren’t the softest material either, kinda of scratchy."
"Andre Andazola","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are heavyweight shirts, not that you would know that by reading the listing. It's not mentioned anywhere!
I bought three packs of these and am incredibly disappointed. Instead of the nice, soft shirts I was expecting I now have to deal with this thick, itchy garbage."

Do not buy!"

"MAG","1.0 out of 5 stars","Too small for a specified size, large. Fabric is not soft. I purchased at Walmart.com Hanes Men's Comfortblend Short Sleeve Tees, large and Hanes Men's Nano-T Short Sleeve Tees, large - and they were of the correct large size and made from very soft fabrics.
Hanes Short Sleeve Comfortsoft Tees are either defective or made of inferior materials and cut smaller by design, just to save about a dollar on a fabric."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not comfort soft. Not sold in a 4 pack. Grey shirt isn't grey but a ""dirty"" white look. Shirts came folded and stuffed in a shipping bag. Feel very thick and heavy compared to the usual Hanes you would find in another store. Product not as advertised."

I returned them and will just buy them at Walmart."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","Counterfeit garbage. Hanes hasn't used a paper tag in years morons! Also I have never seen a shirt that failed to mention what it was made of. If you are going to counterfeit at least do it somewhat well. Have you any pride in the shady work you do? Is there money in counterfeiting undershirts?"

"Jessica","1.0 out of 5 stars","do not like how it fits"
"Tyler Durden","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are advertised as Hanes ComfortSoft shirts, but the items I received (in an unmarked, clear poly bag) were made of a thick, scratchy cotton - like the variety you'd see in a discount t-shirt store."
"TC.","1.0 out of 5 stars","The garments that I ordered claimed to have been 100% cotton, but the goods delivered were labeled 10% Polyester, and weighed noticeably heavier than the white Hanes 100% cotton T-shirts that I bought under the same order."

"Jilloo","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are not soft"
"Oddamber","1.0 out of 5 stars","The material is not soft, and they are not 100% cotton. I need them for tie dye and these will not work. Also, they are not real Hanes brand shirts. They have a weird tag on them that says Hanes, but the label printed on the shirt doesn't say Hanes."

I will be calling in for a refund! =("
"nicthereader","1.0 out of 5 stars","I am 5'11"" with a 33"" waist and 44"" chest. This is the third time I have tried to purchase Hanes ComfortSoft T-Shirts on Amazon. I bought sized Medium and they were nowhere near the Medium Hanes T-Shirt I purchased a few years earlier. They didn't reach my waist and were way too tight. So, I used the sizing charts and purchased an X-L. They arrived and they were sails! They reached nearly to my mid-thigh and had 2-3"" of extra room on EACH side of the shirt. So, I went for broke and bought a size Large.
They arrived. They are EXACTLY the same size as the X-L. Seriously. I put them back-to-back. There is no difference whatsoever in the sizing. The only difference is one is labeled L and one is labeled X-L. So, seeing as a medium makes a guy look like he is in a sausage casing and L and X-L are the same size and make you look like you are wearing a tent, I am of the opinion that I can never purchase t-shirts through Amazon again."

"Christopher Devea","1.0 out of 5 stars","Very disappointed!! Shirt fit ""awkwardly"" and shrank really bad. Now I wear my pants at ""normal"" waist height and when I put the shirt on after washing it, and stand up straight you can see about a 1/4 inch of my stomach. No joke!! I weight 170, 6 ft in height and washed the shirts in cold water and dried them on low heat for 15 min. I will start the return process when I'm done writing this review."

"Noah Turkewitz","1.0 out of 5 stars","Don't buy these shirts. They are CLEARLY counterfeit and not actually Hanes Comfortsoft. I own lots of Hanes Comfortsoft which I've purchased at retail locations (Target, etc.) and this is a completely different, cheap shirt.

"Courtney","1.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered the ""comfort soft"" Hanes tshirts but received the hardest, sandpaper, normal Hanes. NOT comfortsoft as described."
"Casey","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts fit decent upon first wear. The neck does not fit as snug as it should and seems a bit loose compared to other brands I own. I figured ""well, i'll give them a wash and hope the neck tightens up a bit"". What I soon found out after a single wash is the ENTIRE shirt shrunk down to a medium-large. Pathetic. I can not wear these any longer and I don't believe in the Hanes brand any longer. Do they even wear their own stuff to see how it fits?
The neck should be snug and NOT stretch just from putting it on. The length should be long...these are under shirts and as such, need to be tucked in. And they should be washed BEFORE selling, to compensate for shrinkage.
Also. I ordered 2 packages of these. The two separate packages were totally different quality of shirt. The first was a very dark, almost shiny black that felt very soft to the tough and the tagless print on the neck was clearly legible. The second was a rougher quality to the touch and the tagless print was almost unreadable. Not sure whats up with this."

Four Fruit of the Loom shirts from Wal-Mart and 4 Hanes shirts off this site 2 months back. 2 months later, 3 out of the 4 Hanes shirts are in the trash. Each and every single one of them had one small hole and two large holes open up in the lower back of the shirt. What does it say about your product when Wal-Mart low end shirts are of better quality? Anyways, can't recommend purchasing these."
"Midwesterner2","1.0 out of 5 stars","My son has autism and will only wear Hanes Comfortsoft t-shirts next to his skin. I was excited to find them on Amazon, but extremely disappointed when they arrived today and aren't Comfortsoft t-shirts at all. They're just plain old Hanes t-shirts with a tag and everything (see picture). Buyer beware!"
"R. Carter","1.0 out of 5 stars","Both long and short sleeve products are not Hanes “comfort soft” Tee shirt brand even thought they are advertise as such. The fabric feels like regular tees. In fact, I’m not sure if they are genuine Hanes product having arrived in non descriptive plastic bags with only a bar code sticker. If you are looking for comfort soft do not order these tees."
"Rinaldo","1.0 out of 5 stars","Turned into belly shirts after one wash. Although sexy around the house, not comfortable to wear with a dress shirt. Tosses in the garbage. Fruit of the looms did not have this problem. I did not buy these shirts on amazon."
"Bryan Mitchell","1.0 out of 5 stars","I just finished purchasing the same shirts at a store and I loved them. Decided to buy some more but after I received them I can tell they were not authentic. The material of the shirts was off, the tags were printed incorrectly and the sizes of all of the shirts were inconsistent. Buy these directly from a store where you can feel them before hand to avoid the trouble."
"Justin Hawk","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are some downgraded version of hanes comfort soft. comfort soft brand does not have any tags, the logo is printed inside the collar. the quality of material is cheap on these."
"Arthur Digby Sellers","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not as advertised. Counterfeit product. As other posters have said, these are not Hanes comfort soft. They are normal heavy weight T shirts. The Hanes label also disappeared after first wash. I have real Hanes undershirts that I've washed 50 times and the label is still clearly there."
"pedro","1.0 out of 5 stars","I look at the pic and it shows 6 shirts, WHAT A GOOD DEAL! then when you look further you see its a 4 PACK! WTF! I wish amazon would moderate some of this b.s."
"KL","1.0 out of 5 stars","We have been buying Hanes Comfort Soft t-shirts for years. These shirts are definitely NOT Comfort Soft shirts. These shirts are a very coarse material. The t-shirt states that it is 100% cotton but I am not convinced that it is. They have been returned."
"Max","1.0 out of 5 stars","They look like you took a black square and then cut two holes in the top half for arms and then made a hole in the top for your head. If you want to look like a giant square walking around, than this is the shirt for you!"
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","These shirts are packaged in groups of four and i have had to convert many of them over to shop rags because of the tape they use to package them. It sticks and leaves residue on the shirts and through many washings the residue remains (usually right across the front somewhere) So it really doesn't matter how good of shirt it is. You will be throwing a percentage of them away unless you like having glue on the front. Hanes will never do anything different unless people complain. I will find another source for my T Shirts."
"Bobandy","1.0 out of 5 stars","I would not recommend if you want a soft nice shirt."
"Daniel Moulden","1.0 out of 5 stars","Only ONE SHIRT - NOT FOUR! DO NOT BUY THIS!!
Also, it took two WEEKS to arrive. Very disappointed."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","doesn’t match the quality i typically expect from hanes, I suspect maybe these are not authentic hanes brand. shirts fabric is not soft, rather stiff, the fit isn’t right, and they have an odd chemical smell / feel to them. am considering a return of this purchase, not sure if it’s worth the hassle, might just trash the shirts."
"James007","1.0 out of 5 stars","One of the worst purchases I made. Prickly cotton not good for summer time. Waste of money. Not buying Hanes again!"
"James","1.0 out of 5 stars","I always wear a extra large but these fit more like a large. I ended up giving them to a homeless home."
"ADB123","1.0 out of 5 stars","Shirts too large, much different material weight than expected, and folded awkwardly in non original packaging... actually, no packaging at all. Requested return but ended up just throwing them in the trash can. 0 stars out of 5."
"Shreyas","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not comfortable material."
"JZ","1.0 out of 5 stars","Extremely disappointed. I have been buying these undershirts for years. These came and the collar is too wide, and they are tight under the arm pits. Looks like they moved production from the DR to Haiti and quality has gone way down. Do not buy."
"A. Milner","1.0 out of 5 stars","I wear an undershirt everyday, and I recently switched out my white Hanes (which I have never had problems with) to these new black Hanes for when I'm dressed casually.
The material in these black Hanes undershirts is particularly thin, and the seams start to tear out AFTER THE FIRST WASH.
These aren't worth 50 cents. I bought some Jockey brand black undershirts and they are much higher quality."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these shirts expecting actual Hanes products. These shirts aren't real Hanes. The material is ruff and they shrunk after a wash."
"Edanne Andrade","1.0 out of 5 stars","Paid for pkg of 4 shirts like stated in post. Only recieved 1"
"Tom Lewis","1.0 out of 5 stars","Terrible shrinking issue. Shocked to have bought Haines brand and have shirts basically worthless after 2-3 washes. They shrank 2 sizes worth."
"Tiffany Rivers","1.0 out of 5 stars","Material very rough. After washing plus fabric softener, still rough. Very disappointed."
"Nicholas","1.0 out of 5 stars","The is a hole on one of the T shirts. Did anyone check before shipping out?"
"T golfing","1.0 out of 5 stars","The description is deceptive these are very rough in texture! I would be surprised to find out if they are actually 100% cotton as it states on the label."
"MichaelS","1.0 out of 5 stars","it doesn't feel like 100% cotton"
"Steve R","1.0 out of 5 stars","cant wear it after one wash"
"Brenna","1.0 out of 5 stars","Did not receive item described. Item described as 90/10% cotton blend. I received 100% cotton shirts that shrank quite a bit when washed. Not the items I wanted."
"jose","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not worth it to much money for one stupid shirt."
"Faceless Bureaucrat","1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought these from NY Lingerie. The listing said they were 100% cotton, but what they shipped are not. They are 10% polyester. This is not 1975."
"Pen Name","1.0 out of 5 stars","I hate you. The shirts and socks came in seperate orders. What kind of disheveled sweatshop are you running, you kindle pushing Neo nazis. I demand satisfaction!"
"Michael B.","1.0 out of 5 stars","These are NOT Hanes COMFORTSOFT T-shirts. The description of these T-Shirts as “Comfort Soft” is extremely misleading. COMFORTSOFT is a Hanes brand for tagless 100% cotton T-Shirts. The T-shirts I received are not branded Comfortsoft, are not tagless and are NOT 100% cotton. I will be returning this product."
"Cesar Grajeda","1.0 out of 5 stars","OJO, NO COMPREN ESTO!! El producto NO es lo que se anuncia.. Por ningún lado tiene la descripción comfortsoft, solo trae una etiqueta genérica, eso y que el embalaje es una bolsa de plástico transparente me hace pensar que el producto no es original.
Además la tela es sumamente incómoda, con una constante sensación de picazón. Es una pena que al haber usado ya la prenda no la pueda devolver.
Háganse un favor, lean esta reseña y no compren estas cosas. Son pésimas."
"TwinPines85","1.0 out of 5 stars","This product is not 100% cotton! I was very disappointed to receive 4 Hanes t-shirts that were a 50/50 cotton polyester blend."
"Diane","1.0 out of 5 stars","Sewing on shoulders is off making the tea shirt look like it’s on backwards. But it’s not. Husband finds it uncomfortable. Very disappointed. It’s like they are seconds and rejects from the stores so they sell them on Amazon. Already washed them so can’t return"
"Jordan Norczen-Chisholm","1.0 out of 5 stars","The medium floats off of my body, then the small is so tight I can't wear the shirt comfortably. Seems like a really unreasonable size jump, not to mention mediums are manufactured in Haiti and the smalls are in the Honduras. I wonder if outsourcing and immoral, unethical practices (such as outsourcing) have lowered the quality of Hanes products?"
"Cliente de Amazon 777","1.0 out of 5 stars","Se les dio la primera lavada, y una de las playeras se rompió entre el hombro y la manga, como se ve en la foto. No las recomiendo."
"Rory Burnett","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not good. Too big, not soft. Not very long but very wide. Probably the most uncomfortable t-shirt I’ve ever worn. I washed them hoping that would improve the comfort. Nope. Even worse. Straight into the garbage. Not worth wasting a clothes hanger on."
"Andrew","1.0 out of 5 stars","I love the comfort soft cotton tshirts and these were advertised as comfort soft. When I received them they are a much heavier cotton than that and were not even labelled as comfort soft. What gives? Had to open them to find this out which means I can't return them."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","These were the perfect size when I first tried them on but after the first wash it shrunk from the bottom about 4-6 inches, so it's not comfortable to wear anymore. If I put my arms out to the sides it's now short enough that it exposes my belly. Not tagless either."
"Randy Tanaka","1.0 out of 5 stars","In less than a year the seams started to go and now I have holes by the seams. Not recommended."
"Spike","1.0 out of 5 stars","Disappointed.
Advertised as 100 % cotton. Delivered as 10 % polyester."
"TM","1.0 out of 5 stars","At first i liked the t-shirts. Then i saw one of them has a hole. So make sure to check and see all of them. Lack of quality control is disappointing otherwise i would have purchased more."
"Gilles24","1.0 out of 5 stars","NO GOOD, NOT SOFT AT ALL. WILL WASH THE CAR WITH THEM."
"swberry","1.0 out of 5 stars","The cut of the shirts was weird. Too wide in places, too narrow in others and the fabric was aweful. I will never buy again."
"Amazon Customer","1.0 out of 5 stars","To small and they srunk after 1 wash"
"Dwayne C.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Not as advertised, specifically the shirt is not 100% cotton and is not tagless. Still will do around the house but false advertising is garbage."
"Terry","1.0 out of 5 stars","Went from a large to about a small after first wash, huge disappointment."
"Julia","1.0 out of 5 stars","This description is misleading. The picture shown is of 6 pack but I just received a 4 pack. Not cool."
